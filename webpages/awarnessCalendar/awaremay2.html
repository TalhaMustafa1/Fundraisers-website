                                  In 1994 Congress passed the King Holiday and Service Act, designating the King
                                  Holiday as a national day of volunteer service. Instead of a day off from work or
                                  school, Congress asked Americans of all backgrounds and ages to celebrate Dr. King's
                                  legacy by turning community concerns into citizen action. The King Day of Service
                                  brings together people who might not ordinarily meet, breaks down barriers that have
                                  divided us in the past, leads to better understanding and ongoing relationships, and
                                  is an opportunity to recruit new volunteers for your ongoing work.

                                  about America's national lands and their wildlife, and how we can protect them by
                                  doing a better job of saving energy. He saw a connection between protecting the
                                  wilderness and saving energy, and believed if we study both, we will discover some
                                  surprising links. Thanks to Earth Day, you can learn more about wilderness and

                                  resulting in paralysis of all voluntary muscles, including those used for breathing.
                                  Average life expectancy for people with the disease is three to five years after

                                  ALS was first described in 1869 by French neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot, but it
                                  wasn't until 1939 that Lou Gehrig brought national and international attention to
                                  the disease when he abruptly retired from baseball after being diagnosed with ALS.
                                  Most commonly, the disease strikes people between the ages of 40 and 70, and as many
                                  as 30,000 Americans have the disease at any given time

                                  The purpose of <strong>Men's Health Week</strong> is to heighten the awareness of
                                  preventable health problems and encourage early detection and treatment of disease
                                  among men and boys. This week gives health care providers, public policy makers, the

                                  One in three women report being physically or sexually abused by a husband or
                                  boyfriend at some point in their lives.<br>
                                  Every two minutes in the United States, someone is sexually assaulted.<br>
                                  <br>
                                  More than five children die every day in this country as a result of child abuse and
                                  neglect, and up to 15 million children witness domestic violence in their homes each
                                  year.<br>
                                  But what really opened her eyes and subsequently, her heart, was the fan mail she
                                  received. The letters didn't say, "I love your show. Can you send me an autographed
                                  picture?" They said, "I was raped when I was fifteen. I'm forty now and I've never
                                  told anyone." Survivors were disclosing their stories to her, many for the first

                                  <br>
                                  The fact that these individuals were revealing something so personal to someone they

                                  The Red Ribbon Campaign was started when drug traffickers in Mexico City murdered
                                  Kiki Camarena, a DEA agent, in 1985. This began the continuing tradition of wearing
                                  and displaying red ribbons as a symbol of intolerance towards the use of drugs. The
                                  purpose of the Red Ribbon Campaign is to present a unified and visible commitment
                                  toward the creation of a DRUG-FREE AMERICA.

                                  Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce or properly use insulin.
                                  Insulin is a hormone that is needed to convert sugar, starches and other food into
                                  energy needed for daily life. The cause of diabetes continues to be a mystery,
                                  although both genetics and environmental factors such as obesity and lack of
                                  exercise appear to play roles.

                                  an understanding of disability issues and mobilize support for the dignity, rights
                                  and well-being of persons with disabilities. The theme of the Day is based on the
                                  goal of full and equal enjoyment of human rights and participation in society by
                                  persons with disabilities, established by the World Programme of Action concerning
                                  Disabled Persons, adopted by the General Assembly in 1982.<br>

                                  Domestic violence is a pattern of abuse with the goal of establishing or maintaining
                                  power and control over the victim. It can happen occasionally or continuously and
                                  often worsens over time. Domestic violence includes physical, sexual, mental, and

                                  regardless of income, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or religion.<br>

                                  Senator Gaylord Nelson founder of Earth Day conceived of it as a day for learning
                                  about America's national lands and their wildlife, and how we can protect them by
                                  doing a better job of saving energy. He saw a connection between protecting the
                                  wilderness and saving energy, and believed if we study both, we will discover some
                                  surprising links. Thanks to Earth Day, you can learn more about wilderness and
                                  protecting the environment; and with that knowledge and support, the world will have
                                  clean air and water, healthy fish and wildlife, and beautiful places to visit

                                  Compassion, service, empathy, understanding...combine these words with privilege,
                                  talent, skill, energy...and you have a composite picture of the heart and soul of
                                  many volunteers. These elements tell us much more than a head shot or group photo
                                  ever could.
                              </p>
                              <p>Volunteers come in every age, size, shape, and race. They're impossible to profile;
                                  crossing boundaries of geographic location, income level, educational attainment,
                                  philosophical mindset, and religious persuasion. Some sort through e-mail databases
                                  to keep donors abreast of charitable developments. Others provide their legal,
                                  financial, promotional, management and training skills on a pro-bono basis. Still
                                  more change sickbeds, lend an ear, hold anxious hands, and yes, ladle soup and
                                  prepare sandwiches in "soup kitchens" across the country.</p>
                              <p>National Volunteer Week celebrates a myriad of vastly different individuals with two
                                  things in common: a concern for others and the tenacity to turn their concern into
                                  proactive volunteerism. "Volunteers Inspire by Example," is a fitting theme for this
                                  year's National Volunteer Week, happening in April. Event organizers feel the theme,
                                  "reflects the power volunteers have to inspire not only other people to volunteer
                                  but also the people they serve."</p>
                              <p>National Volunteer Week was created by President Richard Nixon's executive order in
                                  1974. Three decades of subsequent Presidents have continued the tradition of
                                  "celebrating and recognizing the power and spirit volunteers give back to this
                                  country."</p>

                                  President George W. Bush's Council on Service and Civic Participation instituted a
                                  new recognition award to coincide with National Volunteer Week in 2004. The award is
                                  intended to honor sustained commitments and significant achievements by American
                                  volunteers. In addition, such national recognition is expected to inspire others and
                                  encourage more individuals to assist neighbors with urgent needs and those in dire
                                  circumstances.

                              <p>The President's Volunteer Service Award is available to kids, young adults, adults
                                  and families/groups. Recipients of the award receive: An official President's
                                  Volunteer Service Award pin; a personalized certificate of achievement; a note of
                                  congratulations from the President of the United States and a letter from the
                                  President's Council on Service and Civic Participation.</p>

                                  Volunteering is a year-round, twenty-four hour a day, seven days a week enterprise.
                                  Every minute of every day, someone is volunteering their time, energy, and talents
                                  to help others. One week a year, these efforts are acknowledged and attempts are
                                  made to increase volunteer commitments across the country.
                              </p>
                              <p>Special efforts are being taken to recognize and inspire young people toward
                                  volunteer service this year. National Youth Service Days kick of the week of
                                  activities on the weekend of April 23rd. This campaign is being spearheaded by Youth
                                  Service America. It is being billed as the "largest national day of service focusing
                                  on youth volunteering."</p>
                              <p>On the opposite end of the spectrum, The National Association of Area Agencies on
                                  Aging will hold their 2004 MetLife Foundation Older Volunteers Enrich America Awards
                                  this April. A fairly recent addition to National Volunteer Week, the program
                                  celebrates its second year of support. They say, "The goal of this awards program is
                                  twofold: to acknowledge exemplary older volunteers and to encourage older Americans
                                  to contribute their knowledge, skills and time to enrich society through
                                  volunteerism."</p>
                              <p>During National Volunteer Week, every year, USA Weekend announces the winners of its
                                  "Make A Difference Day" competitive awards. These awards are sponsored by Paul
                                  Newman, a noted actor, director, and active philanthropist. The awards are bestowed
                                  on the ten most outstanding service projects. USA Today also devotes their entire
                                  Sunday issue, during National Volunteer Week, to volunteering.</p>
                              <p>According to the Points of Light Institute & Volunteer Center National Network:
                                  "During National Volunteer Week, organizations such as volunteer centers,
                                  nonprofits, businesses, government agencies, military units, hospitals, communities
                                  of faith, and schools host awards ceremonies recognizing millions of our nation's
                                  volunteers for their outstanding contributions to their communities over the past
                                  year." Additionally, "Thousands of volunteers participate in local community service
                                  projects (during National Volunteer Week)."</p>
                              <p>Last year's National Volunteer Week included an estimated 2,400 events nationwide.
                                  Almost 500,000 volunteers participated in recognition ceremonies and community
                                  service projects. Media participation is key to promoting volunteerism during this
                                  week of critical visibility. The Points of Light Institute coordinated media efforts
                                  and worked with sponsor, AT & T during 2003's various events.</p>
                              <p>They estimate, "Over 1,600 journalists at over 700 media outlets targeted 115 outlets
                                  in the AT & T market areas. The media outreach resulted in over 300 mentions in
                                  outlets across the country reaching an audience well over 15 million people."
                                  National Volunteer Week Toolkits are available to assist organizations participating
                                  in this year's events. These Toolkits contain media forms and promotional materials
                                  to assist organizations nationwide.</p>
                              <p>During this year's National Volunteer Week, take the opportunity to acknowledge
                                  individuals who generally toil in obscurity. Most volunteers don't advertise their
                                  humanitarian efforts. It's a wonderful thing that our nation observes, honors and
                                  congratulates their efforts on an annual basis</p>
                              <p>It takes a unified effort to help raise the national common denominator through
                                  compassion and service. Look around for people you know that actively sacrifice
                                  their time and talent in the service of others. Take this opportunity to thank them;
                                  and most important of all, learn from their example. Follow the lead of a volunteer
                                  and volunteer.</p>

Can you send me an autographed picture?" They said, "I was raped when I was fifteen. I'm forty now and I've never told anyone." Survivors were disclosing their stories to her, many for the first time.</p>

                                Domestic violence is a pattern of abuse with the goal of establishing or maintaining power and control over the victim. It can happen occasionally or continuously and often worsens over time. Domestic violence includes physical, sexual, mental, and financial abuse. It knows no boundaries: Domestic violence can affect anyone, regardless of income, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or religion.<br>

                        Senator Gaylord Nelson founder of Earth Day conceived of it as a day for learning about America's national lands and their wildlife, and how we can protect them by doing a better job of saving energy. He saw a connection between protecting the wilderness and saving energy, and believed if we study both, we will discover some surprising links. Thanks to Earth Day, you can learn more about wilderness and protecting the environment; and with that knowledge and support, the world will have clean air and water, healthy fish and wildlife, and beautiful places to visit forever.</p>
                        <p>
                            Senator Gaylord Nelson believed strongly that education is the key to changing people's attitudes about the environment, and he devoted much of his energy to that challenge. <a href="http://www.nelsonearthday.net/nelson/" target="clear">READ MORE </a> about Senator Gaylord.</p>

                  <h4><strong>Causes That Inspire</strong></h4>
                  <h2><strong>Global Volunteer Week</strong></h2>
                  
                    <p>
                        <img src="../../images/volunteerweek2006.gif"style="float:left;margin-right:10px;" alt="">
                        Compassion, service, empathy, understanding...combine these words with privilege, talent, skill, energy...and you have a composite picture of the heart and soul of many volunteers. These elements tell us much more than a head shot or group photo ever could.</p>
                    <p>Volunteers come in every age, size, shape, and race. They're impossible to profile; crossing boundaries of geographic location, income level, educational attainment, philosophical mindset, and religious persuasion. Some sort through e-mail databases to keep donors abreast of charitable developments. Others provide their legal, financial, promotional, management and training skills on a pro-bono basis. Still more change sickbeds, lend an ear, hold anxious hands, and yes, ladle soup and prepare sandwiches in "soup kitchens" across the country.</p>
                    <p>National Volunteer Week celebrates a myriad of vastly different individuals with two things in common: a concern for others and the tenacity to turn their concern into proactive volunteerism. "Volunteers Inspire by Example," is a fitting theme for this year's National Volunteer Week, happening in April. Event organizers feel the theme, "reflects the power volunteers have to inspire not only other people to volunteer but also the people they serve."</p>
                    <p>National Volunteer Week was created by President Richard Nixon's executive order in 1974. Three decades of subsequent Presidents have continued the tradition of "celebrating and recognizing the power and spirit volunteers give back to this country."</p>

                    <p>

                        President George W. Bush's Council on Service and Civic Participation instituted a new recognition award to coincide with National Volunteer Week in 2004. The award is intended to honor sustained commitments and significant achievements by American volunteers. In addition, such national recognition is expected to inspire others and encourage more individuals to assist neighbors with urgent needs and those in dire circumstances.</p>
                    <p>The President's Volunteer Service Award is available to kids, young adults, adults and families/groups. Recipients of the award receive: An official President's Volunteer Service Award pin; a personalized certificate of achievement; a note of congratulations from the President of the United States and a letter from the President's Council on Service and Civic Participation.</p>

                        Volunteering is a year-round, twenty-four hour a day, seven days a week enterprise. Every minute of every day, someone is volunteering their time, energy, and talents to help others. One week a year, these efforts are acknowledged and attempts are made to increase volunteer commitments across the country.</p>
                    <p>Special efforts are being taken to recognize and inspire young people toward volunteer service this year. National Youth Service Days kick of the week of activities on the weekend of April 23rd. This campaign is being spearheaded by Youth Service America. It is being billed as the "largest national day of service focusing on youth volunteering."</p>
                    <p>On the opposite end of the spectrum, The National Association of Area Agencies on Aging will hold their 2004 MetLife Foundation Older Volunteers Enrich America Awards this April. A fairly recent addition to National Volunteer Week, the program celebrates its second year of support. They say, "The goal of this awards program is twofold: to acknowledge exemplary older volunteers and to encourage older Americans to contribute their knowledge, skills and time to enrich society through volunteerism."</p>
                    <p>During National Volunteer Week, every year, USA Weekend announces the winners of its "Make A Difference Day" competitive awards. These awards are sponsored by Paul Newman, a noted actor, director, and active philanthropist. The awards are bestowed on the ten most outstanding service projects. USA Today also devotes their entire Sunday issue, during National Volunteer Week, to volunteering.</p>
                    <p>According to the Points of Light Institute & Volunteer Center National Network: "During National Volunteer Week, organizations such as volunteer centers, nonprofits, businesses, government agencies, military units, hospitals, communities of faith, and schools host awards ceremonies recognizing millions of our nation's volunteers for their outstanding contributions to their communities over the past year." Additionally, "Thousands of volunteers participate in local community service projects (during National Volunteer Week)."</p>
                    <p>Last year's National Volunteer Week included an estimated 2,400 events nationwide. Almost 500,000 volunteers participated in recognition ceremonies and community service projects. Media participation is key to promoting volunteerism during this week of critical visibility. The Points of Light Institute coordinated media efforts and worked with sponsor, AT & T during 2003's various events.</p>
                    <p>They estimate, "Over 1,600 journalists at over 700 media outlets targeted 115 outlets in the AT & T market areas. The media outreach resulted in over 300 mentions in outlets across the country reaching an audience well over 15 million people." National Volunteer Week Toolkits are available to assist organizations participating in this year's events. These Toolkits contain media forms and promotional materials to assist organizations nationwide.</p>
                  <p>During this year's National Volunteer Week, take the opportunity to acknowledge individuals who generally toil in obscurity. Most volunteers don't advertise their humanitarian efforts. It's a wonderful thing that our nation observes, honors and congratulates their efforts on an annual basis</p>
                  <p>It takes a unified effort to help raise the national common denominator through compassion and service. Look around for people you know that actively sacrifice their time and talent in the service of others. Take this opportunity to thank them; and most important of all, learn from their example. Follow the lead of a volunteer and volunteer.</p>
