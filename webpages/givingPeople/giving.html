            <h5><strong>The Voice of Bart Simpson is Bringing Light
                <br>
                
to the Darker Side of her City</strong>
<br>
            </h5>
        </div>
        <p>
            At a time of rising crime rates and violence in our cities, Nancy Cartwright is sounding off in an effort to make a difference. Ironically, Nancy has voiced hundreds of animated characters over the past two decades, including that of Bart of The Simpsons phenomenon. But the Emmy winner also speaks for concerned and frustrated residents in her community. So eloquently, in fact, that Northridge, California has named her their honorary Mayor. "I think they made me honorary mayor because I have a big mouth and I'm a ten year-old boy at heart," she stated modestly.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            It's more likely that San Fernando Valley residents appreciate this Hollywood celebrity for her ability to affect change. "I essentially get paid a lot of money to just burp and fart," said Nancy referring to her role at Fox Studios voicing the Bart Simpson character. "I make enough money to where I can focus on good things, and I have the freedom to use my time anyway I want. I feel so blessed and this is the least I can do to give back."
            </p>
            
            <p>
            Two years ago, Nancy was searching for ways to volunteer her services to her community and visited, of all places, her local Chamber of Commerce. "I don't have anything to sell," she politely interjected during a meeting, "But, I'm the voice of Bart Simpson and I want to help?"
            </p>
            
            <p>
            Wayne Adelstein, CEO and President of North Valley Regional Chamber of Commerce, is also the chairman of the board for the Valley Economic Development Center. Adelstein thought that a Hollywood celebrity was just the thing that one of his pet projects needed. He assured Nancy that her heart was in the right place, but explained to her that the Chamber of Commerce might not be the higher calling she was aiming for.

            <p> <img src="../../images/lapdbadge.jpg" style="float: right;" alt="">
            Adelstein introduced Nancy to Lorraine New, President of the Devonshire Police Activities League Supporters (PALS). "Loraine has such an amazing energy and she sets the tone for the whole group," exclaims Nancy. "We have a great relationship. It's like a divine intervention, with our purposes aligned."
            </p>
            
            <p>
            Nancy has served as a fundraiser for the Devonshire PALS board of directors ever since, lightening the burden of community officials campaigning for a new PALS Youth Center. So far the team of supporters has raised all but $200,000 of the $2.5 million needed to break ground on the new facility. "My celebrity status has helped," said Nancy. "We're rounding the final turn."
            </p>
            
            <p>
            Creative in her methods when it comes to fundraising, Nancy invited over 300 celebrities and VIPs to her home for Monte Carlo Night last year. The private party featured a charity poker tournament and an auction to benefit PALS. "Councilman Greig Smith and his office promoted our last event as a grassroots campaign," boasted Nancy about her city official acquaintance.
            </p>
            
            <p> <img src="../../images/officersandoval.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" alt="">
            The event was not only a successful fundraiser, but it also generated a lot of local and mainstream media buzz, inevitably raising awareness. The news reached Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa who was so impressed with the performance from such a small group of volunteers that he added a $1 million grant to the collection. Nancy was so inspired by the outpouring of support that she committed herself to finishing what she started. On 29 September Nancy will host the Second Annual Monte Carlo Night. <i>(Details at the end of this feature)</i>

            "I'm going to keep throwing these events until our mission to build the youth center is accomplished."
            </p>
            
            <p>
            But the clock is ticking, and the current 800-square-foot Park Parthenia Community Family Center is temporary. Thousands of youth benefit from PALS' services and dedicated volunteers every year, making it clear that a larger facility is urgently needed.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            "Officer Sandoval is there every single day," says Nancy referring to Elizabeth who runs the PALS Youth Center, "with 200 kids going through it a week." The proposed new Devonshire PALS Youth Center will allow for increased youth membership, expanding the very programs and services that will discourage, and eventually diminish, gang activity. "My employees actually tutor kids on the weekends," beams Nancy about her staff. "We even tested some of the kids for improved reading skill levels." Nancy also explains the center's strategic location. "Our neighborhood has the highest level of gang infiltration of any in Los Angeles."
            </p>
            
            <p> <img src="../../images/palsyouthcenter.jpg"  style="float: right;" alt="">
            PALS is hoping to break ground on the new 5,000 square-foot facility sometime this year, but plans have been delayed due to funding requirements. "We're only $200,000 shy of our goal," exclaimed Nancy. "Once we've raised the rest of the money we can start building." The Devonshire PALS Youth Center plans include an education room for studies and homework, a computer lab, a library, a mini-gymnasium for sports programs and activities, and outdoor sport courts. The educational programs, adventurous field trips, and wholesome recreation are not only beneficial for local at-risk youth, but could turn the tide for local residences and businesses.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            The simple theory of cause and effect applies to today's growing gang problem. Gangs break down a community's social structure and that perpetuates when at-risk youth lack alternative supervision, guidance, and recreation. Too often our youth have nowhere to go, are exposed to and learn to associate with gangs, and are susceptible to recruitment. Worse yet, they may become victims of crime and violence themselves. Nancy believes the Devonshire PALS Youth Center will provide Los Angeles with a long-term solution.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            "This community youth center is going to make a big difference in providing education and alternative recreation. I want it to serve as a model for others in the future."

            <img src="../../images/policeexplorers.jpg" style="float: right;">The Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) Devonshire Police Activity League Supporters (PALS) has proved that it effectively deters gangs and prevents local crime. For more than 30 years PALS has provided after school and weekend enrichment programs for at-risk children and teens. Those programs help to build strong and positive relationships between youth and the LAPD.
            PALS takes a proactive approach in promoting trust and understanding between young people and police officers by bringing youth under the supervision and constructive influence of dedicated law enforcement professionals. The program is based on the conviction, that young people—if they are reached early enough—can develop strong and positive attitudes toward police officers and the law.

  <P>The American Red Cross just honored Trace Adkins with their Crystal Cross Award. The organizationâ€™s President and CEO, Gail J. McGovern said, "TRACE brings humor, honesty, hard work, and grit to everything he does. We could not ask for a better representative of the Red Cross.</P>
<P>Coincidentally, country music star Trace Adkins just raised more than $1.5 million for the Red Cross which was his charity of choice to receive his win on The Celebrity Apprentice.</P>
<P>On Americaâ€™s Newsroom he told Martha MacCullum why he competed for the Red Cross. â€œWe all know that the Red Cross is always there when huge natural disasters like this happen, but I represented the Red Cross on the Celebrity Apprentice this year because sometimes we forget that they also respond to over 70,000 house fires a year in this country.â€</P>
<P>â€œTwenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, 365, thereâ€™s a Red Cross volunteer somewhere in this country selflessly helping somebody,â€ Adkins said.</P>

Hardest hit is Oklahoma, where severe tornadoes ripped through several counties, destroying or damaging hundreds of homes and leaving as many as 35,000 in the dark. The Governor declared a state of emergency in 16 counties. The Red Cross is supporting first responders and is providing shelter, food, distributing relief items and clean-up supplies and working with local and state officials to ensure people get the help they need.</P>
<P>The Red Cross is also helping in Kansas, Iowa and Missouri, where storms left more than 71,000 people without power.</P>

Ms. Hatcher understands that education is the key to prevention and that prevention will reduce predatory threats. Her role as the National Spokesperson for the AmberWatch Foundation demonstrates her sincere commitment to this cause.</p>
<p>The AmberWatch Foundation is a 501(c)(3) charity dedicated to the prevention of child abduction and molestation. Through its "Be Safe!" Education Program, the Foundation's mission is to (by the end of 2008) educate 25 million elementary-aged children and their parents on how to identify potential endangerment scenarios and stay out of the hands of abductors and predators.</p>
<p>When it comes to issues of personal safety, AmberWatch believes that if the children and parents can see it, hear it, and talk about it, they will learn it! The AmberWatch Foundation <a href="http://www.amberwatchfoundation.org/be_safe/" target="clear">"Be Safe!" Education Program</a> was created to dynamically and proactively educate children and parents on the dangers that exist, and how they can protect themselves.</p>

<h4><strong>Sponsor An AmberWatch For An At-Risk Child</strong></h4>

  The AmberWatch Foundation is all about prevention. And with the AmberWatch, attention is the key to prevention! The goal is to distribute 50,000 
  <strong>AmberWatches</strong> to at-risk children by the end of 2006.</p>
  <p>
    Children wearing an AmberWatch can call attention to themselves at the touch of a button if they are feeling threatened or scared. The AmberWatch's trademarked alert signal and super-bright flashing LED lights mean a child needs help!</p>

    <p>
      The AmberWatch is a tool for prevention. That's why proceeds from every retail sale of the AmberWatch go to support the AmberWatch Foundation. But here at AmberWatchFoundation.org, we have the very special opportunity for our visitors to sponsor AmberWatches for at risk children, while funding the AmberWatch Foundation and its mission to educate children and parents across the nation in abduction and molestation prevention. It's a win-win initiative!</p>
<p><strong>Here's how it works:</strong></p>
<p>Oftentimes those children who need the AmberWatch the most are those who would be least likely to get one. But you can make a difference. For every $25 you donate, an AmberWatch will go out to an at-risk child. At the same time, your $25 will help fund the AmberWatch Foundation and its mission. It's that simple. All you need to do is decide how many children you want to sponsor. <a href="http://amberwatchfoundation.org/project_amberwatch/default.asp" target="clear">Sponsor a child today!</a></p>

    <strong>Non-Smoker Dana Reeve Dies Of Lung Cancer</strong></h6>
  <p>
    I was saddened to hear that <strong>Dana Reeve</strong>, widow of late actor Christopher Reeve, has died of lung cancer at age 44.
</p>
<p>
    First known as a singer/actress, she became a symbol of compassion and dedication while caring for her husband during his near decade of paralysis. A lifelong nonsmoker, she announced her diagnosis in August 2005.
</p>
<p>
    Lung cancer is the leading cancer killer for both men and women. Dana Reeve has brought much-needed attention to the fact that approximately 13% of its victims are non-smokers. In 2004 more than 170,000 new cases of lung cancer and over 160,000 deaths were attributed to the disease in the United States. Smoking is the leading cause, responsible for 87% of lung cancer cases, but there are a number of other factors that contribute, including secondhand smoke, radon, air pollution, and family history. More studies are needed to determine the cause of a 600% increase in lung cancer diagnosis in women since 1955. <i>--Annie Van Bebber</i>

<h2><strong>The People Behind The Cause</strong></h2>
<h6><strong>Christopher and Dana Reeve</strong></h6>
<p>The Christopher Reeve Paralysis Foundation</p>
<p> <img src="../../images/chris_dana_photo.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" alt=""> The most valuable resource for many nonprofit organizations is often a phone call away and more than happy to help put a highly individual face on philanthropic efforts that generally take place with appropriate anonymity.</p>
<p>Executive directors, administrative staff and dedicated volunteers tirelessly work for their clients without expecting anything in return. Those they provide support, encouragement, and services to, may in fact, be thrilled to have opportunities to give back to organizations that have greatly improved their lives.</p>
<p>Through television, radio, newspaper, and magazine interviews and photo sessions, these individuals bring visibility and a great deal of humanity to sometimes abstract medical, societal, and spiritual issues. Such exposure can increase funding for nonprofits, remove psychological stigmas, and provide clients with a sense of giving back and helping others.</p>
<p>Sometimes providing a real-life example is more valuable than lengthy discourses on the ins and outs of attracting media attention with highly personal stories of courageous individuals. Glory Cooper, Executive Director of Mobility Unlimited in Medford, Oregon provides us with a recent example.</p>
<p>Mobility Unlimited is dedicated to helping individuals with mobility problems obtain durable medical equipment necessary to live independent lives. In order to serve their clients, Mobility Unlimited applies for grants and cultivates individual donors. After receiving a grant from the Christopher Reeve Paralysis Foundation, the organization was saddened by news of his death.</p>
<p>
  <img src="../../images/crpf_logo.gif" alt="" style="float: right;">
  As a poignant tribute to Reeve's memory, Debra Phenix, one of the individuals who benefited from his foundation's grant, graciously agreed to be interviewed and photographed for media outlets in Southern Oregon . Glory Cooper sent press releases about Phenix and the grant from Reeve's foundation to the media. She also coordinated a photo opportunity and made herself available for interviews about Mobility Unlimited.</p>
<p>As a real-life example, you'll find an article below that resulted from Cooper's efforts and Phenix's willingness to help. It ran in the Grants Pass Daily Courier newspaper on Tuesday, October 26. It was the featured story on their “Community” page and provided information for others with mobility issues to access organizations that help provide funding for durable medical equipment. It also honored the efforts of the Christopher Reeve Paralysis Foundation, Mobility Unlimited, the Oregon Community Foundation, and private donors.</p>
<p>If there is an individual that's benefited from your nonprofit organization's services, they may be thrilled to make themselves available for press coverage. Regardless of the results, recipients of assistance will likely be flattered by requests for media availability and empowered by the ability to give back.</p>

<h2><strong>Local Woman Benefits From Reeve Foundation</strong></h2>
<h4 style="margin: 0; padding: 0;"><strong>Grants Helped To Buy Wheelchair Lift For Van</strong></h4>
<p>By DeWayne Lumpkin (Reprinted by permission of the Grants Pass Daily Courier)</p>

    <p><strong>Debra Phenix uses a lift to get in her van. She is with her 9-month-old son, David.</strong>

  </div>
  
  Debra Phenix's spirit survived a car accident that left her paralyzed at the age of 10. A spinal cord injury left her with paralysis from the waist down, but she recalls few details from the crash and subsequent recovery. </p>
<p>“I was really young and I don't remember a lot except that I adapted really quick,” she says. </p>
<p>Her life got a little better recently, thanks to a grant from the foundation started by Christopher Reeve, the movie actor who once played Superman. Reeve, who was paralyzed in a horse-riding accident nine years ago, died earlier this month. </p>
<p>Phenix, of Grants Pass, said her teen and young adult years were spent redefining the limits of life in a wheelchair. “I've never wanted a motorized wheelchair, because I feel more in control by using my arms, she says. </p>
<p>Earlier this year, she received a new wheelchair lift for her van. Funding for the lift was coordinated by Mobility Unlimited and included grants from the Christopher Reeve Paralysis Foundation and the Oregon Community Foundation. Individual donors from Jackson and Josephine counties also contributed. </p>
<p>Reeve was most famous for his portrayal of Superman in a series of films during the 1980s. He became an advocate for individuals with spinal injuries after being paralyzed in a horse-riding accident in 1995. Reeve died earlier this month from cardiac arrest. His wife, Dana Reeve, plans to continue their foundation's work involving paralysis research and treatment, as well as advocacy for accessibility for people with disabilities. </p>
<p>The past year has been particularly hectic for Phenix. Since last October, she got married, had her first child and began a new job with Trans Link, operated by the Rogue Valley Transit District in Medford. </p>
<p>Phenix has been transferring herself from her wheelchair to her automobile and then hoisting her wheelchair into the vehicle since she began driving two years ago. She continued this tricky maneuver while she was pregnant. In January, she finalized plans for installation of a wheelchair lift on her van. </p>
<p>“I knew it would be impossible to transport my baby without a lift,” she explains. </p>
<p>Her in-laws realized the cost of the equipment and installation was beyond Phenix's budget and searched the Internet for funding options. They found Mobility Unlimited, a nonprofit agency in Medford dedicated to helping adults obtain durable medical equipment required to live independently and maintain employment. </p>
<p>Mobility Unlimited was established in 2000 by Bruce Hough and Nancy Saum Hough. </p>
<p>“Bruce lives with multiple sclerosis and needed an electric wheelchair,” says Glory Cooper, the nonprofit organization's executive director. “He had the money for his wheelchair, but had to cut through a lot of red tape to get it. Bruce realized the nightmare it must be for people without the means to pay for durable medical equipment and founded Mobility Unlimited to help them.” </p>
<p>Hough is the founder of ComNet Marketing Group in Medford. </p>
<p>Late last year, Cooper applied for a grant from Reeve's foundation and received $2,500 in January. She applied a portion of the grant, along with funding from Oregon Community Foundation and private donors to get Phenix's lift. </p>
<p>“Without the grants, I would've been paying for the lift for a really long time,” Phenix says. The wheelchair lift and installation cost more than $7,500. </p>
<p>“I would've gotten by without the lift if it weren't for my baby,” she says. “My husband, Josh, tried it out before I did to make sure it could handle the weight.” </p>
<p>Phenix says the lift has made her life a lot easier and she appreciates the financial help she received to pay for it. Cooper estimates that Mobility Unlimited has distributed over $100,000 to help about 24 clients purchase lifts, motorized wheelchairs, grab bars and wheelchair ramps. </p>

  "Freedom and security are precious gifts</strong> that we, as Americans, should never take for granted. We must do all we can to extend our hand in times of need to those who willingly sacrifice each day to provide that freedom and security. While we can never do enough to show gratitude to our nation's defenders, <strong>we can always do a little more."</strong>

  They do this by creating and supporting unique programs designed to entertain, educate, inspire, strengthen, and build communities.</p>
  
  
  <p>Actor Gary Sinise has spent decades performing on stage and screen, but he's 
  probably best known for a single role: Lieutenant Dan in Forrest Gump. In the 
  film, he portrays an Army officer who loses both legs in Vietnam, a character that 
  made Sinise something of a patron saint to real-life amputees. Inspired by their 
  heroism, Sinise co-founded the Lt. Dan Band in 2003 to entertain U.S. troops and 
  raise money for gravely wounded warriors.</p>

<h2><strong>The People Behind the Cause</strong></h2>
<p> <img src="../../images/giving-wendijosmall.jpg" style="float: right;" alt="">
<strong>Wendie Jo Sperber</strong>, actress, comedienne, and Founder of weSPARK Cancer Support Center, passed away November 29th after a long battle with breast cancer. Wendie, a Los Angeles native, began her professional acting career while still in high school. She went on to star in numerous films, including Steven Spielberg's "1941", Robert Zemeckis' "I Wanna Hold Your Hand", the "Back to the Future" trilogy, and Neil Israel's "Moving Violations" and "Bachelor Party", to name a few.</p>

<p>Her television credits include starring with Tom Hanks in "Bosom Buddies." She also had series leads in "Private Benjamin", "Women in Prison", "Babes", and "Hearts Afire." An Emmy was awarded to the production of the after-school special "Dinky Hocker Shoots Smack" in which Wendie starred. She also appeared on the poignant breast cancer episode of "Murphy Brown."  More recently, Wendie guest-starred on "Will and Grace" and recurred on "8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter".</p>

<p>Her theatre credits include Wendy Wasserstein's "Isn't It Romantic", a starring role opposite Ron Silver in "As You Like It", and many more, for which she received numerous Drama Critic Awards.</p>

<p>Diagnosed with cancer in 1997, Wendie founded weSPARK Cancer Support Center in Sherman Oaks, California in 2001 to provide free services including support groups, information on the latest research, classes, teen and wee Spark children's groups, and much more, to many cancer "warriors", their families and friends.</p>

<p>
  <img src="../../images/bcancer2stamp.jpg" style="float: left;margin-right: 10px;" alt="">
  It was Wendie Jo who unveiled and promoted the breast cancer stamp with the U.S. Postal Service. She was named 1999 Woman of the Year by the Los Angeles County Commission for Women, received The Namaste Spirit Award 2003 from the Namaste Interfaith Center, the 2004 Mordecai Kaplan Award for Distinguished Service by the University of Judaism, and was recently honored by the Jennifer Diamond Foundation.</p>

<p>Tom Hanks says of Wendie Jo, "The memory of Wendie Jo Sperber is that of a walking inspiration. She met the challenges of her illness with love, cheer, joy and altruism through weSPARK, and an unstoppable supply of Goodness. We are going to miss her as surely as we are all better for knowing her."</p>

<p>Wendie Jo leaves behind a son and a daughter, parents Charlene and Burt, sisters Ellice (Dale) and Michelle, brother Richard (Shawn), nieces, nephew, Chris Ramsey, aunts, uncles, her weSPARK family, and countless friends.</p>

<p>The family requests that donations in her honor be made to <a href="http://www.wespark.org/donate.php" target="_blank"><strong>weSPARK</strong></a> in lieu of flowers.</p>

<p>The following is a feature story we did on Wendie last year...</p>

<h2><strong>Wendie Jo Sperber <br>
  weSPARK Cancer Support Center</strong></h2>
  <p>
    <img src="../../images/wendie.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" alt="">
    When sparks fly from a flint, flames ignite and life-saving warmth is spread. These are perfect symbols for describing the friendly fire of Wendie Jo Sperber's steely determination to help others after she was diagnosed with cancer. Her passionate response to a life-threatening illness led to weSPARK Cancer Support Center - a place that feels like a friend's home, not an institution.</p>
    <p>As a single mother and actress, Wendie experienced the initial devastation of being diagnosed with breast cancer. She realized that - similar to the way cancer insidiously spreads through human bodies - the effects of the disease spread from the patient to their friends and family. weSPARK's holistic approach is evident in their focus on the mind, body and spirit as well as their inclusion of the families and friends of cancer patients at a supportive meeting place filled with hope, strength and personal experience.</p>
    <p>Wendie told us that, "Hearing the words - 'you've got cancer' - irrevocably changes one's life. Nothing is as it was before. Even the most brilliant doctors could not close my heart and eyes to the emotional and spiritual needs of those affected by this disease. The hardest battle to be fought is on the emotional front." She was stunned to find the San Fernando Valley - where she and two million others live - had no cancer support center. "My dream was to open much-needed, non-institutionalized cancer support centers," she stated.</p>
    <p >
      <img src="../../images/sparklogo.gif" style="float: right;" alt="">
      Founded in the spring of 2001, weSPARK is a place filled with love, laughter and essential emotional support. It's a place that emphasizes Wendie's realization, "We're not alone." That's the message she wanted to convey to other cancer patients. Ironically, only months after weSPARK opened its doors, Wendie was told her breast cancer had spread to her lungs and bones. At that point, she and countless others needed the wonderful programs and fellowship offered at weSPARK more than ever before.</p>
    <p>Through weSPARK, Wendie has created a place that's more akin to a loved one's home than a medically related establishment. The setting is conducive to a continuous cycle of sharing, caring and informing those touched by cancer, either through a personal diagnosis or a loved-one's experience with the disease. The vast majority of our country's population has been forced to confront cancer in one way or another. weSPARK strives to enhance their lives with activities, education and open communication.</p>
    <p> 
      <img src="../../images/Drumming Circle.jpg" style="float: left;margin-right:10px ;" alt="">
      weSPARK's list of scheduled activities sounds more like an itinerary for a week at summer camp than a list of offerings from an organization dealing with life-threatening medical conditions. Diversionary options include: Drumming Circle, Scrapbook Workshop, Tai Chi, Mah Jongg, Yoga with after-class fellowship and a teen Drama Club Workshop. A wide range of emotionally supportive options include: Caregiver's Support Group, Guided Imagery, Men's & Women's Stag Support Groups, Bereavement Group and a Re-run Support group for people with a cancer recurrence. Holistic and Qi Gong Energy Sessions are available weekly or by appointment.</p>
    <p> 
      <img src="../../images/relax.jpg" style="float: right;" alt="">
      A philosophical approach that provides relief from the onslaught of doctor's visits and medical concerns and focuses on emotional support and healthy group activities for anyone dealing with cancer is weSPARK's greatest strength. In nourishing hearts, minds and souls they enable individual's to cope with the exhausting effects of many cancer treatments. Wendie credits founding members, volunteers and the success of the annual weSPARK Golf Classic with turning her dream into reality.</p>
    <p>Fundraisers.com was excited by an opportunity to attend last year's weSPARK Golf Classic at Glen Annie Golf Club in Santa Barbara . "Star-studded," doesn't begin to describe the host of Hollywood celebrities participating in the tournament and simultaneous fundraising activities. An outdoor, tented supper was a decidedly gourmet affair. Tables were sold-out prior to the event, though late-comers were treated to a cocktail and appetizer reception and invited for live and silent auctions.</p>
    <p>

        <p class="text-center" style="padding-inline: 3px;"><strong>Cindy Crawford, Robert Hays and Sparkle</strong></p>
      </div>
      Bryan Cranston, who plays harried father Hal on Fox Television's Malcolm in the Middle, kept his composure and proved wildly entertaining as the celebrity auctioneer for a live auction that culminated with a new GT Mustang Convertible donated by The Ford Motor Company receiving a winning bid of over $35,000. Cindy Crawford Ð charming alone Ð proved irresistible to animal lovers who went wild over Sparkle, a black Labrador puppy included in the auction. She drew on her catwalk experience as a supermodel to sashay through the audience, allowing Sparkle to get up-close and personal with a $5,000 winning bid.<br clear="ALL"></p>
    <p>
      <img src="../../images/auction.jpg" style="float: right;" alt="">
      The silent auction was one of the most impressive Fundraisers.com has seen over many years of attending similar events. Gorgeous gift baskets, exotic travel packages, autographed memorabilia and fine art tempted attendees to place their secret bids throughout the evening. weSPARK schedules a variety of fundraising events throughout the year culminating with the Annual Golf Classic which grows more impressive each year. A Mah Jongg Tournament was scheduled for those who preferred an indoor affair and weSPARK unplugged continued the festivities into the evening.</p>
    <p>A partial list of notables who signed up to participate Ð many answering a 7:30 AM tee-off call - includes: Brett Cullen, Bruno Kirby, Bryan Cranston, Chris Rich, Christopher Atkins, Cindy Crawford, Craig Shoemaker, Daphne Bragdon, David Leisure, David Naughton, Eric Martsolf, Erich Anderson, Galen Gering, George Wendt, Jack McGee, James Hyde, James Sutorius, Jeff Davis, Jenna Von Oy, Joel Murray, Kato Kaelin, Kenny Rankin, Louis Mandylor, Marc McClure, Mindy Sterling, Molly Culver, Nancy Allen, Richard Schiff, Robert Hays, Ryan Stiles, Stuart Pankin, Super Dave Osborne and Yancey Arias. The heartwarming celebrity response demonstrates a tremendous level of support for Wendie's weSPARK Foundation &amp; Cancer Center.</p>
    <p>

      The life-enhancing experiences available at weSPARK are similar to memorable times spent with friends and loved ones. The warmth and glow continues to nourish long after afternoons and evenings filled with conversation, concern and a commitment to be there through the long haul. As Wendie reminded visitors, "You're never alone."</p>
