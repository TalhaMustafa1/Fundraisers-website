          <h4><strong>Featured Idea:</strong></h4>
          <h2><strong>Great American Duck Races: On Your Mark, Get Set….Float?</strong></h2>
          <p><img src="../../images/seaimage.jpg" alt="" style="float: right;">
            Preliminary visions of the duck races – webbed feet placed in starting blocks, feathered chests waddling
            towards the finish line – were quickly dispelled as two industrial front loaders unceremoniously dumped over
            13,000 rubber ducks into the mighty Rogue River. The bathtub buddies raced from the Parkway Bridge to the
            Caveman Bridge in approximately 45 minutes. The excitement was palpable as the duck's adoptive parents
            waited for the winners at Riverside Park. An estimated 500 supporters were on hand at the finish line.</p>
          <p>The minimal cost of adopting a duck - $10.00 each – encouraged local residents to help the Rotary Clubs
            raise funds for a news sports facility, Morrison Centennial Park. The generous prizes were integral to the
            success of the events. The grand prize, $20,000 toward a car from a Grants Pass Auto Dealership went to Tina
            Lindall, a waitress at Galice Resort and student at Rogue Community College. She found out she was the big
            winner when her sister called on her cell phone. Lindall says "I was so excited, I had to pull over to the
            side of the road.”</p>
          <p><img src="../../images/ducks5.jpg" alt="" style="float:left; margin-right: 10px;">An additional 14 prizes
            were worth an average of $1,000 each. This brought the total prize incentives for the event to more than
            $35,000. Gerry Watt, a Grants Pass local, bought the family package of five ducks. His purchase also came
            with a t-shirt, valuable coupons to local merchants and a mini version of the rubber ducky. When the voice
            on the other end of the phone asked for Gerald, he assumed it was a telemarketer and almost hung up.
            Luckily, he listened long enough to learn he'd won a home decorating package worth $1,500 at Gates Home
            Furnishings, a local business.</p>
          <p>Joan Bille won a $1,000 gift basket from Gottshalks Department Store. When she found out the races were
            happening on her birthday, she sent her husband out to buy ducks. She says "I never win anything.” She did,
            however, feel lucky because of the fortuitous timing. Her husband, John, said they considered the four ducks
            they purchased a $40 donation to the new Sports Park. "Community support for events like the duck races is
            why we live here,” he said. Winning was an added bonus.</p>
          <p> <img src="../../images/ducks2.jpg" style="float: right;" alt=""><i>The Rogue Duck Derby</i> presented by
            the <i>Rotary Clubs</i> of Grants Pass, Oregon capitalized on the novelty of the event. New concepts are
            especially important for communities inundated with requests for donations and non-stop fundraising drives.
            Government funds for non profits have been stretched thin and cuts to extra curricular education programs
            have sent parents and participating kids out to raise money for clubs and teams that were once funded by
            school districts.<br>
          </p>
          <p><i>The Great American Derby Duck Race</i> is a fund-raising concept owned by <i>Great American Merchandise
              &amp; Events</i>. They began staging the events in 1988 and recently added a turtle character to their
            lineup. The rubber racers are bar-coded for immediate identification of winners. A funnel-shaped boom is
            stretched across the finish line to capture the winners.<br>
          </p>
          <p>Both the duck and turtle characters are trademarked by their three inch size, sunglasses and an appropriate
            smile. <i>Tim Matykiewicz</i>, a </p>
          <p> <img src="../../images/sea.jpg" alt="" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;"> <i>American Races</i>
            representative estimates the duck and turtle races have raised over three million dollars in the last two
            years with more than 200 races around the world. <i>The Great American Races</i> concept is poised for
            explosive growth with successful events like the recent Grants Pass race.
          </p>
          <p>Media sponsorship was crucial to the success of the event. The crowds gathered at the finish line at
            Riverside Park were treated to entertainment from local radio station sponsors, <i>KAJO</i> and <i>KLDR</i>.
            The Duck Races were also promoted by <i>KDRV Channel 12 News</i> and the <i>Grants Pass Daily Courier</i>
            newspaper.<br>
          </p>
          <br>
          <p> <img src="../../images/people.jpg" style="float: right;" alt="">Local businesses provided sponsorship on
            three levels: Super Duck Sponsors – Gates Home Furnishings, Premier West Bank and Southern Oregon
            Sanitation. Rogue Duck Sponsors: Hellgate Excursions, Home Valley Bank and <i>Bill Thorp/State Farm
              Insurance</i>. Quacker Sponsors included 17 local businesses, national franchises and church/civic
            groups.<br>
          </p>
          <p>The participating <i>Rotary Clubs</i> are thrilled with the results. Sponsors covered most of the $40,000
            costs to stage the event and plans are already underway for next year's duck races. In an interview with the
            <i>Grants Pass Daily Courier</i>, race organizer <i>Bill Thorp</i> said, <i>"The community's been
              unbelievable, they got a chance to help kids and have some fun”!</i><br>

            <h2><strong>New To Fundraising?<br>First Time Fundraising Tips</strong></h2>
            <p>These quick and simple tips for first time fundraisers will get you on track and on your way to the first
              of many successful fundraisers.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <h6><strong>Decide how Much Money Your Group Needs To Raise</strong></h6>
                <p>This will help you evaluate products and programs that will be ideal for your group.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h6><strong>Watch For Hidden Costs</strong></h6>
                <p>Don't let your group's profits disappear because of hidden costs (ex. shipping, prizes).</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h6><strong>Give Yourself And Your Group Lots Of Time To Prepare</strong></h6>
                <p>Select your fundraising program early. This will give you lots of time to plan. Include your
                  fundraiser on the school or community calendars and newsletters.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h6><strong>Timing</strong></h6>
                <p>Make sure to stagger the various fundraisers to avoid flooding your potential consumers and to avoid
                  competing with other fundraisers.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h6><strong>Set Up Specific Dates And Stick To Them</strong></h6>
                <p>If you avoid setting clear target dates the campaign tends to drag on and often without direction.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h6><strong>Try To Conduct Fewer And More Effective Programs</strong></h6>
                <p>This will help maintain motivation and avoid "fundraising fatigue".</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h6><strong>Rely On Your Fundraising Company's Expertise</strong></h6>
                <p>Ask lots of questions and use your fundraising company's suggestions and advice.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h6><strong>Stay Motivated Throughout The Program</strong></h6>
                <p>Some organizers tend to lose interest once the program is underway. Put a 10-12 day time limit on
                  order taking. It's easier to stay motivated with clear goals and deadlines.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h6><strong>Communicate Clearly Before, During And After The Program Is Put In Place</strong></h6>
                <p>Keep energy levels high by reminding parents, teachers, and other volunteers of the fundraising goals
                  and deadlines.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h6><strong>Avoid Shipping And Ordering Problems</strong></h6>
                <p>Work closely with your volunteers and assure their order forms are legible and filled out completely.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h6><strong>Keep Copies Of The Order Forms</strong></h6>
                <p>Always keep copies of the order forms before you send them to your fundraising company.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h6><strong>Recruit Adult Volunteers Ahead Of Time</strong></h6>
                <p>This will make the distribution of the products to the volunteers more efficient.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h6><strong>Double Check Products Received Against Your Order Forms</strong></h6>
                <p>This needs to be done before the products are given to the volunteers to ensure that nothing is
                  damaged or missing.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h6><strong>Keep Absent Volunteers Informed</strong></h6>
                <p>Don't forget to communicate the program's kick-off and other important meetings to absent volunteers.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>

            <h4><strong>Fundraising Tips:</strong></h4>
            <h2> <strong>How To Pick The Right Fundraising Product And Key Questions</strong></h2>
            <p>
              Usually the first question that you ask yourself when you realize your group needs to raise funds is:
              "What Are We Going To Sell?" Get expert knowledge on how to make the right choice.<br>
              <br>
              There are thousands of products available for fundraisers that range from candy to wrapping paper, cookies
              to inspirational goods, and nuts to sausage and cheese. After all, almost anything can be re-sold by
              groups for a profit.<br>
              <br>
              Think about the following six questions to help you choose the right fundraising product or program for
              your group:<br>
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <h6><strong>How Much Money Does Our Group Need To Raise?</strong></h6>
                <p>Come up with a goal that is based on your group's needs not just one that sounds good. If your group
                  needs to raise a few hundred dollars, lollipops or a small order of candy bars may be appropriate. If
                  you need to raise over $5,000, you may want to use an order taker fundraiser like a popular chocolate
                  brochure program or a cookie dough fundraiser.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h6><strong>What Would We Enjoy Selling?</strong></h6>
                <p>Your group members will determine the success of your fundraiser. Ask them what they would like to
                  sell and what they'd absolutely not like to sell. The more they like the products, the more confident
                  and motivated they will be to sell them.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h6><strong>What Has Worked For Us In The Past?</strong></h6>
                <p>'If it ain't broke don't fix it' As the saying goes, if you've had success with a certain program
                  year after year- stick to it. Chances are, your supporters are expecting you at that same time every
                  year and your participants are comfortable with selling the product.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h6><strong>How Fast Do We Need The Money?</strong></h6>
                <p>Pre-sale programs (order taker) do take longer than direct sale programs (candy bars, lollipops
                  etc.). If you need to raise funds within 1.5-2 quick weeks, we suggest you fundraise using direct-sale
                  products. If you have 4 weeks or more to wrap up your fundraiser, a pre-sale (order taker) brochure
                  may be ideal.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h6><strong>Are The Products We Want To Sell Of High Quality?</strong></h6>
                <p>A consumer will be happy to support a worthy cause, however they won't be very interested in paying
                  for inferior or significantly overpriced products. Remember that your fundraiser may be an annual or
                  semi-annual event, and nothing builds profits like a reputation for offering top-quality products.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h6><strong>Does The Price Point Match The Income Level Of The Community?</strong></h6>
                <p>As well, make sure that the retail price of the products offered is priced fairly. Offering a fairly
                  priced good at a price that's affordable to help a good cause will lead to quick success!</p>

            <ol>
              <li>
                <h6><strong>Try A Breakfast, Lunch Or Dinner Fundraising Event</strong></h6>
                <p>Food is always a good fundraiser so try a fundraising breakfast, lunch, or dinner event. Keeping it
                  simple is best. A Hotdog event fundraiser is a great way to start. Have your local grocer donate the
                  hotdogs, buns, condiments, chips, and pop. Set up in a busy area, even the parking lot of your grocer.
                  You can use a propane BBQ or boiler for the cooking. Offer up a package deal like "1 Hotdog, bag of
                  chips and can of pop for only $3!" This way you can raise more, faster. Important: Be sure to thank
                  your grocer by giving them recognition for their food donation.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h6><strong>Have A Car Wash</strong></h6>
                <p>A great service and event fundraising idea for all those car-loving people out there. Get your group
                  volunteers together and pick a central location with high car traffic. Make sure you have room for
                  cars to line up and have a few hoses going so you can wash more than one car at a time. As an added
                  fundraiser, sell some snacks and beverages to car owners. Be sure to have enough chairs and shade for
                  your car owners to sit while they wait.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h6><strong>Run A Recycled Bottle, Can Or Ink Cartridge Drive</strong></h6>
                <p>An excellent fundraising idea for our times. Raise money and do good for the environment. Let your
                  community know that they can drop off their refundable bottles, cans, or ink cartridges at a central
                  location. Your group will handle the sorting and keep the refunds. A nickel or dime may not seem like
                  much, but if this fundraiser is well publicized, all that plastic, glass, aluminum, and cartridges
                  will add up quick. To raise more and as an added incentive/service to your community, you can go door
                  to door to pick up their refundable bottles and cans or tie in with a local business to become a
                  drop-off location for your group.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h6><strong>Have A Bake Sale</strong></h6>
                <p>Always a favorite event fundraiser even though it isn't the "newest idea". Why? Well because
                  home-baked goodies can't be beat. Also because some community members love baking and sharing with
                  others. It's recommended to not have these too often though so try spreading them throughout the year.
                  Here's a great tip: Bake some scrumptious cookies using the cookie dough from a popular cookie dough
                  fundraising brochure and make sure to have your order book ready to sell from and raise extra money.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h6><strong>Set Up A Book Sale</strong></h6>
                <p>Another old favorite fundraiser. People are sure to donate books they are done reading and people
                  will be sure to buy them as a good read and a good cause. Ask people to drop off their unwanted books
                  or better yet just go door to door. If you find your fundraiser has left over books you may even want
                  to donate them to a hospital, shelter, or seniors home.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h6><strong>Have A Lawn Or Garage Sale</strong></h6>
                <p>Most everyone thinks about clearing out "stuff" from their attic or garage, well here they can do
                  good too. Have a Lawn sale fundraiser where your community donates items they are willing to let your
                  group sell. Then your group picks a central location to hold your fundraising lawn sale. Once again be
                  sure to publicize this well in advance and many times.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h6><strong>Organize A Rubber Duck Race</strong></h6>
                <p>This event fundraiser is fun and can get kids involved. All you need to do is get the rubber ducks or
                  any other fun thing that can float. Have them numbered to match tickets you sell to supporters. Make
                  sure your event is publicized so you can have a fun turnout on the day of the race at your local
                  stream or body of water. The first duck to cross the finish line wins a prize that was donated by a
                  local sponsor.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h6><strong>Have An Auction</strong></h6>
                <p>The most common way of doing an auction fundraiser is to have collectibles such as pro-athlete or
                  celebrity-signed items (jersey, baseball, bat or hockey stick, movie poster, video tape or DVD) up for
                  sale. Your local pro-sports team or celebrities are usually willing to do this for a good cause.
                  Consider an Online Auction for some of the more lucrative items that were donated. If you don't have a
                  group member that can post them online, check out a local eBay retailer store to sell your items. <a
                    href="../../webpages/resources/charityPoker.html"><strong>Read about how you can sell your items
                      online at iSOLDit.</strong></a></p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h6><strong>Organize A Night At The Races</strong></h6>
                <p>A fun and new way to have an exciting fundraising event. Not actual gambling, "A Night At The Races"
                  is a re-creation and meant for fun. People watch a pre-taped horse race and bet and win "funny money".
                  Raffles are usually drawn throughout the event. What you need to get started, including the video
                  tape, race program, and race tickets are all provided by companies like "A Night At The Races".</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h6><strong>Have A Bingo Night</strong></h6>
                <p>Bingo nights are always popular so try a Bingo night fundraiser. Do it all in the same way as a
                  normal bingo does it; sell cards and call numbers in your school gym or church basement. Instead of
                  money for prizes, give away items donated from your local businesses and be sure to give them
                  recognition for them. As always, good publicity will make your bingo night fundraiser a success.</p>

            <h2><strong>Getting Your Fundraiser Noticed</strong></h2>
            <p>"If you run it they will come..." Not quite. Don't assume that everyone will find out about your
              fundraiser. Get the word out ahead of time and make it as visible as possible.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <h6><strong>Get Your Fundraiser Advertised Or Publicized</strong></h6>
                <p>MOST important is that people know about your fundraising event. Be sure to make the message clear:
                  WHO it's for, WHAT it's for, WHEN, WHERE and HOW much you are trying to raise. Use local radio station
                  community spots, community paper, school and church newsletters, local TV, posters, and flyers. <a

                      press release.</strong></a></p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h6><strong>Pick A Central And Well Known Location</strong></h6>
                <p>Pick a location that everyone knows by name; just directing to an address will reduce your
                  attendance. Also, pick a location that can handle the requirements of your fundraising event as well
                  as crowds.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h6><strong>Choose The Right Day</strong></h6>
                <p>Saturdays are usually best. Most people are not working and have fewer family or religious events to
                  attend. Also, check your calendar so you're not competing with another big event or holiday. Better
                  yet, try to set up your fundraising event to take advantage of the other event's people traffic.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h6><strong>Ask Trusted Volunteers To Help</strong></h6>
                <p>Make sure you get the commitment of your fundraising event volunteers. Your fundraiser will fall
                  short if you can't rely on your helpers. Have backup volunteers lined up in case of absent helpers.

            <h4><strong>Fundraising Tips:</strong></h4>
            <h2><strong>Six Ways To Motivate Your Fundraising Group</strong></h2>
            <p>A little motivation can go a long way. Motivate your group with prizes, prizes and more prizes without it
              costing a lot!</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <h6><strong>Intangible Rewards</strong></h6>
                <p>Rewards with no cash value are proven motivators and provide great entertainment. A few examples
                  include:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Pie Throwing:</strong> Allow the participants to throw cream pies at the organizers' faces
                    if the goal is reached! (you might not like this one but it usually gets the money raised)</li>
                  <li><strong>Camp Out:</strong> Have the principal camp out on the roof of the school or the group
                    leader(s) camp out somewhere awkward if the goal is achieved. Set an even bigger goal to extend the
                    number of days they must camp out there.</li>
                  <li><strong>Activity of Choice:</strong> Let your group have an activity of their choice that replaces
                    their normal schedule (for example: a free afternoon of sports activities in the school yard instead
                    of class)</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h6><strong>Raffles And Prize Draws</strong></h6>
                <p>For each small goal attained (ex. for every 10 units sold or $100 in sales reached), the participant
                  gets their name put in the raffle for various merchandise. The more they sell, the more times they can
                  have their name put in the raffle and the more chances they have to win.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h6><strong>Grand Prize For Your Top Seller</strong></h6>
                <p>Reward your top seller with a Grand Prize. It may be a computer, a bike, movie tickets, cash, or
                  anything else that inspires your group members. Don't get carried away and offer something your group
                  can't afford.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h6><strong>Rewards For Top Class or Team</strong></h6>
                <p>This is a great way to motivate teamwork in your group. If you're a small group, you can create teams
                  by putting your members in groups of twos, threes, or fours. If you're a school, you can do it by
                  class, and if you're a league, simply do it by team. You can offer the best-selling group a free pizza
                  party, a field trip outing to the place of their choice... ask them what they'd like. Try an ice cream
                  social; everybody likes ice cream! <a
                    href="https://www.fundraisers.com/resources/dandy_don.html"><strong>Read about an ice cream social

              </li>
              <li>
                <h6><strong>Completion Prizes For Individuals</strong></h6>
                <p>Offering individual completion prizes is great because they motivate and reward everyone in your
                  organization. Offer a completion gift once your member raises a certain amount. For example: Receive
                  $10 cash for every $100 of product sold. Other completion prizes may be a gift certificate to a music,
                  video, book, or sports store.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h6><strong>Reward Your Early Birds</strong></h6>
                <p>To help move your fundraiser along, you can offer early bird prizes to the first, second, and third
                  person who reaches a specific objective by a certain deadline. For example: if you launch the
                  fundraiser on Monday, you can say the first three people that generate $100 in sales or more by Friday
                  will receive a $15 gift certificate.</p>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Also Remember:</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <h6><strong>Ask Sponsors for Prizes:</strong></h6>
                <p>You can get many prizes for free by simply asking your local restaurants, sports, book and music
                  stores, as well as other local retailers. Tell them what it's for and offer to mention their name in
                  the parent letter and at the campaign launch.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h6><strong>Choose the Right Rewards:</strong></h6>
                <p>What could be worse than no incentives and rewards? Investing in rewards which simply don't motivate
                  your members! Make sure the rewards you choose are relevant to your member's age group and interests.
                  Ask them what they'd like to receive as incentives given a certain budget.</p>

            <h2>How To Reach Your Fundraising Financial Goals</h2>
            <p>There's a lot to think about when planning your fundraiser but make sure you don't miss these key factors
              your fundraiser's plans.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <h6><strong>Identify Your Needs And Set Your Goals</strong></h6>
                <p>The first essential steps to a successful fundraising campaign are to identify your group's needs and
                  set your group's financial goals. If your group members know how the money will be spent and their
                  personal benefits, this will motivate them, keep them focused and help with their sales pitch.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h6><strong>Don't Focus On Percentage (%) Profit Alone!</strong></h6>
                <p>Although the percentage profit for the products you are selling is important, there are many other
                  factors that need to be considered at the same time. One company may offer 50% of sales while another
                  may offer 40%. The 40% company may be providing valuable services such as consulting, kickoffs,
                  incentive programs, timely delivery of merchandise, and custom packing. These advantages will save
                  your volunteers time and lead to higher profits overall. The company offering the lower % may also
                  have a higher quality product. This product's high quality will also help to increase sales and
                  profits for your group. If a company is offering a lower percentage profit, find out why!</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h6><strong>Get Your Participants Motivated</strong></h6>
                <p>In most cases, the money raised is a strong incentive, but often prize award programs can be a
                  valuable way to build excitement and boost profits. Be sure to ask your participants what would
                  motivate them and don't forget to be creative.</p>

            <p>What should your group use, direct-sale fundraising products or pre-sale brochures for your next
              fundraiser? Get the pros and cons on both.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <h6><strong>Fundraising With Direct Sale Products</strong></h6>
                <p>How Direct Sale Fundraising Typically Works:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li> Your group orders an inventory of products; these products are distributed to your group members
                    who sell the products directly to their supporters; funds are collected at the point of sale.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>PROS</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Requires only one contact with individual consumers</li>
                  <li>Direct sale takes less time than Pre-Sale because there is no product to deliver and no returned
                    goods to deal with</li>
                  <li>Usually has a very low retail price per item which results in an easy sale</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>CONS</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Slight risk if you over-purchase</li>
                  <li>Less variety of products to offer</li>
                </ul>

                <h6><strong>Fundraising With Pre-Sale Fundraisers (Order Taker Brochures)</strong></h6>
                <p>How Pre-Sale Fundraising Typically Works:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Your group requests one brochure per fundraising participant. The participants show the brochure
                    to potential supporters. The supporter selects a product from the brochure which the participant
                    records on the brochure order form. These order forms are then returned to your fundraising company,
                    who fulfills the order and ships the products to your group. Your group members and volunteers
                    deliver the products to their supporters. Funds can either be collected at the time of the selection
                    or upon delivery.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>PROS</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>No risk because it requires no guesswork on how much to order</li>
                  <li>Brochures offer a wide variety of products and range of prices</li>
                  <li>Easy to include parents and adults in the fundraising efforts by having them circulate the
                    brochure at work</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>CONS</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Can require more time to complete because products must be delivered and may require dealing with
                    broken or missing items</li>

            <h4><strong>Fundraising Tips:</strong></h4>
            <h2> <strong>How To Choose A Fundraising Company</strong></h2>
            <p>Whether you're a first time fundraiser or a veteran fundraiser, you'll be faced with the same decisions.
              One of them will be how to choose a fundraising company. It's difficult enough to plan a fundraiser, so
              make sure the company you choose works with you and isn't just in it for a quick sale. Below are some
              things to think about during your search and decision process.</p>
            <h4><strong>Good Fundraising Companies Ask Questions</strong></h4>
            <p>
              Good fundraising companies will need to know about your group to help you the best. This is what they
              should ask you:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Your Group's Financial Goal</li>
              <li>Your Fundraising Timeline</li>
              <li>The Number Of Potential Participants And Their Ages</li>
              <li>
                Any Historical Info You Can Provide
                <br>
                <span style="font-size: -2; face: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
                  (e.g. past fundraisers, participation levels, successes and failures)
                </span>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              If they don't ask these questions, then they are not interested in your needs. It's in a good company's
              best interest to care and help make your fundraiser a success. They are looking to build customer loyalty
              and they want to generate repeat business.</p>
            <h4><strong>Important Things To Know About A Fundraising Company</strong></h4>
            <ol>
              <li>How long has the company been in business?</li>
              <li>How many years of experience does the company representative have in fundraising?</li>
              <li>Do they listen to your needs and are easy to work with? If so, then they will help you later if
                problems arise?</li>
              <li>Are their products of high quality? If so, then your fundraiser will raise more with less hassle?</li>
              <li>What is the percentage profit of sales? Although the percentage profit is important, there are many
                other factors that need to be considered (product quality, shipping included, time-saving help).</li>
              <li>What services are available to save you and your volunteers time and energy? Does the company provide
                checklists, collection envelopes, tally sheets, and pre-sorting?</li>
              <li>Are products paid for in advance or upon delivery? Will they work with you on a fair payment option?
              </li>
              <li>Is there an incentive or prize program? If so, who pays for it?</li>
              <li>How are products shipped and when? Who pays the freight?</li>
              <li>What is the policy regarding damaged or unsold product? What about back orders?</li>
              <li>Can the company provide references?</li>

            <h2> <strong>Top Ten Tips For Fundraising Success</strong></h2>
            <p>After consulting fundraising experts, here's a top 10 list of things that all fundraisers need to know to
              raise more and have fun too!</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <h6>Use Basic Sales Techniques For Better Fundraising</h6>
                <p>
                  Perfect your introduction. Never start with the question "Would you like to buy..?" because the
                  standard answer is 'NO.' Students should introduce themselves, their group and their group goal with
                  major emphasis on the GOAL. What's the money going to provide? Student volunteers who communicate the
                  organization's purpose make better ambassadors. Look "professional" &amp; Say "thank you". A nice
                  appearance and identifying apparel adds credibility and helps make the sale. If possible, wear a group
                  uniform or a tee shirt with school logo. Remember to say "thank you for helping us meet our goal," and
                  restate the goal.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h6>Choose The Right Incentive Prize</h6>
                <p>
                  What could be worse than no incentive prizes? Investing in incentive prizes which simply don't
                  motivate your participants! Make sure the prizes you get are relevant to your participant's age group
                  and interests. Ask them what they'd like to receive as incentives given a certain budget.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h6>Motivate Team Work</h6>
                <p>
                  Top Class or Team Prizes: This is a great way to motivate the kids and get them working as a team-
                  perfect synergy! If you're a small group, you can create teams by putting your participants in groups
                  of twos, threes or fours. If you're a school you can do it by class and if you're a league simply do
                  it by team. You can offer the best selling group a free pizza party, a field trip outing to the place
                  of their choice. Ask them what they'd like.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h6>Reward The Early Bird</h6>
                <p>
                  You can offer early bird prizes to the first, second and third person who reaches a specific objective
                  by a certain deadline. For example: if you launch the fundraiser on Monday, you can say the first
                  three people that generate $100 in sales or more by Friday will receive a $15 gift certificate.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h6>Set Clear Goals And Firm Deadlines</h6>
                <p>
                  The key to fundraising success is to establish clear fundraising goals and set firm deadlines for
                  reaching those goals. Identify what you need, how much money is required and how long it will take to
                  get it. Otherwise, your fundraising activity can be never-ending. So simply set beginning and ending
                  dates for all fundraising projects. That way everybody knows that there will be closure and things
                  won't drag on.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h6>Best To Do Fewer Fundraisers- And Do Them Well</h6>
                <p>
                  Most fundraising companies who work with organizations to raise money agree that, with fundraising,
                  less can be more. Your fundraising company should be consulting its customers to do only a few
                  fundraisers but, importantly, to do them well. Not only should schools and school groups be watchful
                  of their own fundraising efforts, many advise that it is good practice to know what other groups in
                  the area are doing to raise money.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h6>Avoid Duplicating Another Group's Fundraiser</h6>
                <p>
                  Today children and their parents are fundraising for their schools in addition to raising money for
                  other groups. So it's important to know what, where, when and how others are doing in fundraising. The
                  last thing you want to do is duplicate the efforts of others and over saturate the community. You are
                  only hurting each other. Some groups plan at least one year in advance so that they can coordinate
                  fundraising efforts with neighboring teams, schools and other groups (church, scouts, etc.) who may be
                  selling in the community at the same time.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h6>Product Quality Does Count</h6>
                <p>
                  The old saying "You get what you pay for." Is true for fundraiser campaigns and they're fundraising
                  products. The quality of the product you sell to your supporter is a direct reflection of your group.
                  It will also have a direct effect the next time you fundraise. Higher quality fundraising products
                  will leave people with a positive image of your cause. It will also make your current and next
                  fundraiser easier because supporters will be eager to buy from you, resulting in higher profit.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h6>Fundraise At Your Events And Games</h6>
                <p>
                  Have you ever considered selling products in the stands during games, tournaments, and other events?
                  Well you should because high people traffic equals higher sales. Plus you can raise more in less time.
                  Some groups are so good at this, supporters look for them at each game and event.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h6>No Money Down Fundraisers</h6>
                <p>
                  Is your group short on funds to buy fundraising products up-front? Choose an order-taker fundraiser.
                  Getting an order-taker fundraiser started costs you nothing. Take your orders, collect your money
                  up-front and then place your order with your fundraising company. A simple way to raise funds without
                  putting any money up-front.

              Hershey's Kisses, Reese's Peanut Butter Cup, M&M's and Reese's Pieces. Once all orders are taken and the

            <p>Since cookie dough fundraising is an order taker fundraiser, you can start fundraising without putting
              any money down. This is great if you are low on cash to begin with. Most tubs sell for $10 and expect to
              make between 35% - 55% profit depending on how many tubs your group sells. Make sure to choose a
              fundraising company that provides free shipping since the weight of tubs can add up fast. A group size of
              20 or larger is usually recommended, but any group can raise anywhere from $1,000 - $10,000 and more if
              they are motivated and focused.
              <br><br>The taste of freshly baked cookies is sure to get anyone's mouth watering, so you might want to
              consider cookie dough since it's likely to be as easy to sell as cookies are to eat!

            <h2> <strong>Small Town Poker Tour</strong></h2>
            <p>
              <img src="../../images/smalltownpoker.gif" style="float: right;" alt="">
              <strong>The Small Town Poker Tour</strong> raised over $57,000 for the United Way, in Lafayette, LA. This
              event is a great example for all charities. "If your event contains the proper elements, success will
              follow. We approach every event like it is the Super Bowl for the charities we work with. What you can
              raise in one evening with poker, could realistically take many charities six months to raise in a year's
              time", stated Mark Fracalossi STPT creator.
            </p>
            <p><img src="../../images/pokerunitedway.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" alt="">
              The <strong>United Way</strong> event also maximized their potential by successfully selling sponsorships
              and having a great selection of food and beverage which added more funds directly to the bottom line.
              Sponsorships can range anywhere from $5,000 to $100,000; depending upon how actively you solicit sponsors.
              There are many possibilities to create sponsorship packages that include all sorts of branded items from
              custom made table felts with the sponsors design to poker chips. The Chips and felts can then be auctioned
              off for the charity. The United Way had a unique array of regional food items including jambalaya. You can
              take this further by having a food partner donate the food or provide staffing and items.</p>

            </div>
            <br>
            <p>The event drew over 550 players who all paid a $60 entrance fee, plus had a chance for unlimited $25
              rebuys for the first two hours and a $50 add on after that. A rebuy is when a player's chip count falls
              below a certain level and the player is allowed to rebuy</p>
            <p>Besides the fact that Charity Poker Events are successful, the players experience is what enhances that
              success. "If you do your homework and concentrate on the player's experience, you will have a very
              successful event." Fracalossi added.</p>

                Featured Idea:
              </h4>
              <h2>Pulver Enterprises Gambles on a Charity Poker Tournament</h2>
              <p><img src="../../images/happy people.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" alt="">No-Limit Texas
                Hold’em has a vocabulary all its own. It isn’t spoken with a thick southern drawl, it sounds like
                something uttered in a foreign tongue. “I’ve got 73 diamonds and I’m all in. Flop: Ace - 3 – King
                offsuit; Turn: 7; River; 7. I double up with 7’s full. Next hand – 7-3 diamonds again. I’m all in –
                again. I get another caller (one with enough chips to take me out). They’ve got pocket 6’s. Flop comes:
                Ace of Diamonds - 4 of Diamonds – 8 of Diamonds. I hit my flush on the flop. Then: the Turn comes: 5;
                and a 4 at the River. The nut flush is a winner.”</p>
              <p>In mid-October, Pulver Enterprises gambled on adding a, “Best Bet for the Cure: Charity Poker No-Limit
                Texas Hold'em Tournament” to their “Voice on Net” conference in Boston and won big. Not only did their
                event raise money for the Diabetes Research Institute Foundation and The Barton Center for Diabetes
                Education, they upped the ante for other nonprofit organizations interested in betting on poker’s
                resurgent popularity.

              </p>
              <p>The VON Conference already had a number of high-profile attendees expected, but adding John
                Ratzenberger and Phil Hellmuth to the list of poker tournament players was a major coup. Ratzenberger is
                famous for his role as “Cliff” on the long-running television series “Cheers” and he is the current host
                of the Travel Channel's "Made in America.” He’s also a poker aficionado. Hellmuth is a regular at the
                World Series of Poker and one of the all-time top money makers in professional poker.</p>
              <p><img src="../../images/pcom_logo.gif" style="float: right;" alt="">Jeff Pulver, CEO of Pulver
                Enterprises, realized his company’s lead attorney, Jonathan Askin, had an inside edge on dealing a
                charity poker tournament into the VON Conference’s winning hand. In addition to being a member of the
                Bar, Askin once played on the professional poker circui</p>
              <p><img src="../../images/baldman.jpg" alt="" style="float: left;margin-right: 10px;">His official title
                at Pulver Enterprises is “Wartime Consiglieri.” That distinctive moniker hints at his propensity for
                attack strategies when launching a new venture. “It’s important for charities to be savvy when dealing
                with gambling and charity events,” Askin says. “We’re working on a template that will help other
                organizations hold similar events.”
              </p>
              <p>Askin had a stroke of genius that allowed Pulver Enterprises to stage the Boston tournament. They
                tipped the legal scales in their favor by financial contributions going toward raffle tickets. Winners
                of the tournament received the coveted Pulver Cup and bragging rights, but prizes with monetary value
                went to holders of raffle tickets. Remember, raffles are legal in Massachusetts (and most other
                states)…Poker is not!</p>
              <p>Askin explains, “The Boston event represents an incredibly steep learning curve. Once you’ve pulled it
                off once, it becomes a lot easier.” Pulver recently dealt Danny Askin, Jonathan’s brother, into the
                game. “My brother’s come on board to explore the logistics of holding charity poker tournaments on a
                regular basis,” he says.</p>
              <p><img src="../../images/group of people.jpg" style="float: right;" alt="">
                “I’ve never looked at poker as a vice. It’s more a game of skill than luck,” Askin says. He explains
                that playing poker has more in common with participating in a celebrity golf or tennis tournament than
                shooting craps or spinning a roulette wheel. “It’s interesting that states allow raffles to be held -
                which involve no skill, only luck - but it’s really hard to pull off a charity poker tournament.”
              </p>
              <p>There’s nothing like a poker tournament to kickoff a conference, according to Askin. “The game lends
                itself to very dramatic events at very precise, knowable moments that you don’t see in golf or tennis
                tournaments. I don’t know if I can capture exactly how sociable our event was. When someone yelled ‘I’m
                all in,’ 100 people would surround the table to see the hand played out.”</p>
              <p>“Probably, the greatest thing about kicking off a conference with a charity poker tournament is giving
                the attendees a chance to get to know each other in an intimate and psychologically revealing way,”
                Askin says. “If a person plays in a charity golf tournament, they may get to know the other three people
                in their foursome. With poker, everyone’s table hopping and you end up meeting about 100 people in your
                industry - people you may end up dealing with professionally.</p>
              <p><img src="../../images/biding.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" alt="">He adds, “I
                particularly loved that we had Michael Gallagher, President Bush’s chief advisor on telecom policy and
                Stan Wise, President of the Association of State Regulators. In the real world, tension heightens the
                drama at the poker table which, in many ways is a microcosm of the real world. There was one great
                moment when Mike, the President’s telecom advisor, went ‘all-in’ against Phil Hellmuth. Mike prevailed.
                That was a priceless moment.”
              </p>
              <p>“You learn things about people while playing poker that you’d never find out otherwise,” Askin says.
                “You see how they react to pressure and whether they play it safe.” The 5,000 attendees at Pulver</p>
              <p><img src="../../images/von.gif" style="float: right;" alt="">Enterprises’ “VON” Conference were given
                an opportunity to pre-register for the tournament and staggered start times were designed to accommodate
                varying arrival times.
              </p>
              <p>The credit for being able to focus on charity poker tournaments goes to Jeff Pulver, according to
                Askin. “Jeff does everything he can for diabetes. He was raised with a very charitable heart.” Pulver’s
                generosity is a driving force behind development of a matrix for other organizations to model future
                charity poker events on.</p>
              <p>The complexities of holding such an event can’t be fully addressed in the space we have available, but
                a synopsis of the Boston VON Conference tournament highlights follow:</p>
              <p><img src="../../images/building.jpg" style="float:left; margin-right:10px;" alt="">
                “Best Bet for the Cure: Charity Poker No-Limit Texas Hold'em Tournament,” was underwritten by Pulver.com
                with proceeds benefiting the Barton Center for Diabetes Education, Inc. and the Diabetes Research
                Institute Foundation (DRIF).The sole mission of the DRIF is to support the Diabetes Research Institute
                (DRI) at the University of Miami School of Medicine, a recognized world leader in cure-focused diabetes
                research.</p>
              <p>The event included extensive gambling action in a professional Vegas-like environment with cocktails
                and appetizers throughout the tournament. Participant entry fees were largely tax deductible by
                benefiting diabetes charities.</p>
              <p>Winners of the Charity Tournament advanced to the Celebrity Tournament later in the evening. The last
                player sitting at each event took home the coveted Pulver Cup. In addition, players and other
                participants purchased raffle tickets at $100 per book of five. Players received 5 free tickets.</p>
              <p><img src="../../images/gentlemens.jpg" style="float: right;" alt="">The top prize in the raffle was a
                $10,000 buy-in to the World Series of Poker Main Event in Las Vegas with roundtrip airfare on JetBlue
                included. An astounding $5 million prize went to the 2004 WSOP winner, with second place receiving $3.5
                million. Prizes at the 2005 event are expected to increase considerably. Additional prizes included
                technology equipment and services related to “voice on net.
              </p>
              <p>Ofer Gneezy, President and CEO of iBasis, won the $10,000 WSOP buy-in. Brian Leske, from the Governor
                of Massachusetts office, took the Charity Tournament Championship.</p>
              <p><img src="../../images/hugs.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" alt="">Shannon Pendergrast
                was a last minute walk-in, signing up for the opportunity to play against Phil Hellmuth. Pendergrast
                walked away with the Celebrity Tournament Championship. The late afternoon tournament winner was
                Vladimir Greysukh. The players agreed that it was the best event they’d ever experienced at a
                conference.</p>
              <p>Adding a regulated activity, such as poker, could present challenges that most fundraising campaign
                managers are unable to contend with. </p>
              <p><img src="../../images/awardgiving.jpg" style="float: right;" alt="">Askin believes partnerships with
                state-sanctioned poker rooms or Native American Casinos and the charity poker matrix they’re developing
                may help alleviate some legal and logistical headaches. He explains, “Organizations would be able to
                draw from the pool of dealers at Native American casinos and legally hold poker tournaments on their
                premises.” Since these facilities are already designed for poker games, equipment rental expenses and
                staffing costs could be reduced by forming partnerships with existing casinos. “Plus, holding an event
                for charity would be great PR for the casino,” he adds.</p>
              <p>Individuals and companies might consider hosting a charity poker tournament to benefit a nonprofit

              <p><img src="../../images/Ricordi Blue Scrubs.jpg" style="float: right;">
                Pioneering new technologies in islet transplantation and other cellular therapies since the early
                1970’s, the DRI has successfully reversed diabetes in patients involved in ongoing clinical trials. The
                most comprehensive diabetes research facility of its kind, the DRI conducts a broad range of scientific
                programs focused on gene therapy, pancreatic stem cell development, molecular biology and transplant
                immunology, among others, to speed the most promising findings from the lab to the patient.</p>
              <p>"The DRI continues to make important strides in diabetes research and islet cell transplantation. In
                fact, we have made more progress in the last three years than in the last three decades, with patients
                living insulin free for the first time since being diagnosed with the disease," says Camillo Ricordi,
                M.D., Stacy Joy Goodman Professor of Surgery and Medicine, and scientific director of the Diabetes
                Research Institute. Through the dedication of so many generous individuals, like Jeff Pulver, who
                continues to go above and beyond to support our research initiatives, we will move ahead with our
                groundbreaking work and fulfill our mission of finding a cure for all people living with diabetes.</p>

            <h2> <strong>Grants Pass: The Little Southern Oregon Town That Could…and Did</strong></h2>
            <p><img src="../../images/clearweather.jpg" style="float: right;" alt="">
              On September 27, <i>Grants Pass, Oregon</i>, population 23,003 raised <b>$300,000</b> for local charities
              on a single day. Two major events were scheduled for the same Saturday and succeeded by aiming at
              distinctly different segments of the community.<br>

            </p>
            <p><i><a href="ducks.html" target="_top"><b>The Great American Duck Race</b></a></i> was a decidedly
              democratic affair. It represented 13,339 mostly local residents adopting ducks, of the yellow rubber
              variety, for $10.00 each. The event grossed more than <b>$133,000</b> dollars with <b>$120,000</b> going
              directly to a new Sports Park, courtesy of three local <i>Rotary Clubs</i>.<br>
            </p>
            <p><i><a href="bears.html" target="_top"><b>The BearFest 2003</b></a></i> was a highly successful fine art
              auction benefiting <i>21 local charitable organizations</i>. It depended on fewer donors, but the twenty
              one winning bids totaled <b>$175,500</b>. Life-size fiberglass bear statues became blank canvases for the
              artistic vision of local painters, sculptors and designers. Each bear was sponsored by a local business.
              The total proceeds from each successful bid goes directly to a local charity chosen by the sponsor.
              <i>Evergreen Federal Bank</i> was the major sponsor and project coordinator of <i><a
                  href="bears.html"><b>BearFest 2003</b></a></i>.<br>

            <p><img src="../../images/bear.jpg" style="float: right;" alt="">
              Those involved with both fund-raising events agree, <i>"Grants Pass is a very generous community."</i> If
              actions speak louder than words, the impressive <b>$309,490</b> raised is hollering at the top of its
              lungs for other communities to take notice.<br>

            <p> No, they’re

              the Mini Turbo Turtle characters trademarked by Great American Merchandise
              &amp; <img src="../../images/turtle_close.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;">Events
              (GAME) do have a future so bright they’re sporting some pretty
              cool shades. GAME has morphed a fundraising product that has proven
              highly successful for large charitable organizations into a package
              designed for individual schools, church groups, PTA’s and smaller
              community groups.</p>
            <p>
              The original
              Great American Duck &amp; Turtle Races have managed to raise hundreds
              of thousands of dollars per event since their arrival on the fundraising
              circuit. These large scale events are closely monitored by GAME and
              the “adopted” rubber characters are leased for the duration
              of the event only. The Mini Turbo Turtle Races can now be purchased
              by smaller organizations and used repeatedly for seasonal or annual
              events or to jazz up other ongoing fundraising efforts.
            </p>
            <p>Mini Turbo
              Turtle races staged by these school, civic and community groups and
              others have raised tens of thousands of dollars for worthy causes. If
              a picture is worth a thousand words, the photos from these events provide
              an encyclopedic volume of satisfied supporters. Organizers and participants
              alike are charmed by the infectious smiles and giggling excitement awaiting
              the results at the finish line.</p>
            <p>Henry
              Shaw from the Boys and Girls Club of Paris, Texas is thrilled with the
              results of their Mini Turbo Turtle Race on August 31, 2003. They purchased
              the Big Kahuna package and “adopted” 2,412 of the 3,000
              available turtles. This resulted in a net profit of <img src="../../images/greenery.jpg"
                style="float: right;">$27,000.
              Shaw says, “This is hands down the most BANG for your buck!”
              Marketing for the event included ads on six radio stations and the local
              paper. Shaw reports he has “tried several different fundraisers
              in the past, and this one has taken the least amount of work for the
              most money.” They are already planning for this year’s event.</p>
            <p>Jay McCall of Life Donor USA in Tucson, Arizona provides a testimonial of his experience with GAME’s Mini
              Turbo Turtle Racers. His organization arranged charitable “adoptions” for 700 Mini Turbo Turtles from a
              Li’l Dipper (1k) package their first year. Minimal advertising included a website for the event; they
              relied on personal solicitation as the main marketing tactic. Life Donor USA raised $7,000 the first year
              with the smallest available package. They charged a $10 “adoption” fee for each turtle. Their next race
              will be Aug. 14, 2004 at the Hilton hotel using their pool and water slides. Additional turtles will be
              purchased closer to the event date.</p>
            <p>The Walton County Chamber of Commerce initiated a modest event in April of 2003. Pam Tedesco indicates
              their first foray into fundraising with Mini Turbo Turtles was done with “no formal advertising, only word
              of mouth.” The race took place in a large, figure-eight shaped pool with turtles being dropped down a
              waterfall. The Li’l Dipper (1k) package resulted in the “adoption” of 300 turtles. Efforts are underway to
              increase participation for their next event and the Walton County CCOC plans to purchase additional
              turtles from GAME.</p>
            <p>Other organizations staging Mini Turbo TurtleTM Races include: Park Lane Academy Band in Tyler Town,
              Mississippi and the 21st Century Preparatory School in Racine, Wisconsin; both groups purchased 3,000 Mini
              Turbo Turtles. The Jackson Hole High School Booster Club in Jackson Hole, Wyoming and the AISD Education
              Foundation, Inc. in Alvin, Texas each bought 2,000 of the decidedly green, aquatic reptiles. Parker Middle
              School PTA in Taunton, Montana and the Pi Kappa Phi in Oxford, Ohio each ordered 1,000 of the sporty,
              rubber characters.</p>
            <p>According
              to Phil Gordon, Vice President of Events at GAME, “The Mini Turbo
              TurtleTM Race, unlike our signature event, the Derby Duck <img src="../../images/green pool.jpg" alt=""
                style="float: right;"> Race®,
              is a racing package in which the client owns the characters outright
              (they are leased for a duck race). The Mini package includes the Mini
              Turtles, Adoption Shells, a racing manual, a small quantity of promotional
              merchandise, and use of GAME logos and trademarks – all of these
              items can be used by the client at their discretion.”</p>
            <p>Most planning periods for a Mini Turbo Turtle Race average about two to three months. The clients
              experience in planning events is crucial to time allotted for development. GAME reports the four key steps
              to a successful race are: capturing media for advertising; securing sponsorship for prizes and monetary
              contributions; sales; and logistics. All of these key steps are the responsibility of the client. GAME
              does not offer customer service support for any of the Mini packages. The client assumes complete
              responsibility for all aspects of the Mini event.</p>
            <p>Great American Merchandise & Event’s Duck and Turtle Races provide a wonderful complement to traditional
              fundraising efforts like walk-a-thons, candy drives and charity auctions. The unique ability to purchase
              Turbo Turtles provides nonprofit groups with the ability to stage annual events, amortizing the initial
              cost over a period of time and multiple Turtle Races. Turbo Turtle Races are fun and exciting; perfectly
              geared for schools, children’s charities or any fundraising effort appealing to the child in all of us.

              Boston's fundraising circuit. Dining, dancing and yes…diamonds. A pair of diamond earrings weighing in at
              2.0 carats and set in 14KT white gold, valued at $10,000, to be exact. One lucky attendee exited the

              caliber don't happen overnight, yet successful elements can be adapted on a smaller scale while growing an
              annual fundraiser. Joslin Diabetes Center began raising money for the High Hopes Fund for Kids with
              Diabetes in 1993. Ten years of support have yielded nearly six million dollars benefiting the Elliot P.
              Joslin Camp for Children with Diabetes, Joslin's Young Children's and, JumpStart programs, Joslin's School
              Age Program and Islet Transplant Research Programs.
            </p>

            <p>The dazzle power of the "Diamond Tower" has been a highlight of past High Hopes Diamond Galas. In March
              of 2000, one unset stone was placed in each of the 500 flutes forming a stunning Crystal Champagne Tower.
              Four hundred and ninety nine of the champagne flutes held a cubic zirconia. One of the crystal glasses
              held a 2.0 carat Millennium Diamond appraised at $20,000.</p>
            <p>This year's event was centered on a pyramid of 300 jewelry boxes containing one pair of diamond solitaire
              studs mingling with 299 pair of quality cubic zirconia earrings. Boston's DePrisco Jewelers were diamond
              partners for the 2003 event. Patrons were given the opportunity to purchase a pair of earrings for $150.
              Even the imposters were set in 14KT white gold. At the very least, participating supporters walked away
              with a carat for each ear; only a certified gemologist could identify them as knock-offs. It isn't
              difficult to imagine the palpable excitement as attendees in formal attire waited to hear if they needed
              to place an after hours call to their insurance agent before leaving the ballroom.</p>

            <p> The sophisticated promotional materials for Joslin Diabetes Center's High Hopes Diamond Gala included
              various press releases, impressive invitations and supportive informational packages. Many experienced,
              inspired, and talented individuals contribute to the overwhelming success of Joslin's annual event. Casual
              observers might caution smaller organizations with the cliché: "Kids, don't try this at home." We prefer
              Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland's time honored exclamation, "Come on kids, let's put on a show." A creative
              approach and solid work ethic can overcome many obstacles including lack of experience and limited
              funding.</p>
            </p>
            <p>The unique idea of surrounding an upscale "raffle" with an air of mystery could be adapted to relatively
              modest fundraising efforts. Consider selecting a popular local artist and producing a limited edition of
              signed/numbered prints of a particularly appealing image. Hundreds of charitable supporters could purchase
              the guarantee of an artist signed print; with an approximate value similar to the cost of participation.
              One lucky contributor would win the original; worth considerably more than the contribution.</p>
            <p>Similarly, picnic baskets could contain gift certificates with lunch for two to various local
              restaurants. One picnic basket might contain a private party for ten at a particularly prestigious
              regional restaurant. Again, no one goes home empty handed and individual contributions escalate due to the
              potential for a relatively big pay-off. The thrill of discovering the winner can be incorporated into
              multiple venues and retain excitement throughout a lengthy fundraiser.</p>

            <p><img src="../../images/debating.jpg" style="float: right;" alt="">
              Expert fundraiser <strong>Sue Shifrin-Cassidy</strong>, founder of <b>KidsCharities.org</b>, recently
              produced a highly successful benefit concert at the Ridgefield Playhouse for Movies and the Performing
              Arts in Ridgefield CT, starring award winning entertainer and husband, <strong>David Cassidy</strong>.
              David and his band, in the midst of an international tour, dropped into this historic 500 seat theater for
              one night only and brought the house down! Adding to the excitement of the evening was an unannounced
              musical appearance by musician <strong>Paul Schaeffer</strong> of the Late Night Orchestra. Paul stepped
              in to play keyboards on David's signature song "I Think I Love You". Proceeds of $78,000 from the concert
              and live charity auction, which alone raised over $30,000 in less than 30 minutes, were earmarked for
              worthy children's charities including the <strong>Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>Great entertainment for a great cause is a winning combination that you can use for your next fundraiser.
              Even if you don't have access to headline performers, gifted emerging artists are everywhere! Request a
              donation of time and talent in return for exposure the performer will gain by appearing at your next

            <h2> <strong>MissionFish: Sell Donated Items At Auction To Support Your Cause</strong></h2>
            <div>
              <p><img src="../../images/MF-color-logo.gif" alt="" style="float: right;">
                Fundraisers are often overwhelmed with leftover items from rummage sales, flea markets, and White
                Elephant events. Historically, much of this unsold inventory has ended up at local thrift shops,
                benefiting other nonprofit organizations. Now,
                <strong>MissionFish</strong> and <strong>eBay</strong> offer an alternative solution for selling much
                appreciated donations.
                <br>
                <br>
                This exciting collaboration allows individuals, local community fundraisers, and nonprofit organizations
                an easy way to raise money online. In-kind contributions, obscure collectables and unsold auction items
                can be quickly and easily transferred into desperately needed funds.
                <br>
                <br>

                There are two ways a nonprofit can use this new opportunity to fundraiser:
                <br>

                1) Your supporters can list items on eBay Giving Works and donate a portion of the proceeds from
                anything that sells. 2) Your nonprofit can sell on eBay Giving Works – putting special event auctions
                online, or turning in-kind donations into cash.
              </p>

              <p><img src="../../images/MissionFish-Home.jpg" style="float:left;" alt="">
                Independently, eBay and MissionFish have impressive histories of helping nonprofits, of all sizes, help
                themselves. Together they’ve teamed up to offer Giving Works and The Giving Assistant, both trendsetting
                programs for fundraising. Buyers and sellers are given opportunities to support their favorite causes
                while trading on eBay.
                <br>
                <br>
                MissionFish provides nonprofit verification, donation collection and disbursement, tax receipting, and
                online contribution tracking. It’s the combination of eBay’s formidable presence in the online
                marketplace and MissionFish’s functional expertise within the philanthropic industry that’s resulting in
                impressive returns for worthy causes. This union of buyers, sellers, nonprofits, and cause-marketers has
                been dubbed The Marketplace for Change; an altruistic tool by any other name would be hard pressed to
                prove itself more powerful.
                <br>
                <br>
                There are over 85 million eBay users currently and that number is going up constantly. Almost 1,800
                nonprofits are register to potentially benefit from this enormous list of sellers.
                <br>
                <br>
                Shoppers are rewarded for purchasing items in the Marketplace for Change by having a portion of the
                money they spend donated to a worthy nonprofit. Sellers are given the opportunity to donate a portion of
                their sales to a pre-selected cause. Upside: 1) Satisfaction in making a difference and supporting
                positive change. 2) Assurance that your donation gets to the intended nonprofit. 3) A guarantee that the
                selected nonprofit is legitimate and in good standing. Downside: We haven’t found one.
                <br>
                Additionally, those unable to offer significant cash donations can now offer their services in support
                of worthy causes. Legal, financial, business and other areas of expertise can be offered on eBay in
                support of nonprofit organizations. MissionFish has developed a way for these services to benefit worthy
                causes with cash donations and simultaneously reward donors with a well deserved tax break.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Kristin Cunningham</strong>
                , senior manager of eBay Charity, reports, "To date, nonprofits have raised nearly $30 million on eBay,
                benefiting more than 500 charities in 2002 alone." She continues, "eBay is excited to be working with
                MissionFish to make it even easier for our community to give back to those in need."
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Sean Milliken</strong>
                , executive director of MissionFish says, "Since we started MissionFish, our nonprofit members have
                hoped that one day we would bring our solution, which they love, to a larger community like eBay. We are
                thrilled to have this opportunity to create and manage this tool for eBay so that nonprofits can have
                access to a whole new revenue stream for the important work they do."
                <br>
                Garnering wisdom from an age old axiom, MissionFish recognized a need and continues to exceed
                expectations in filling it. The specific need in this case was an effective tool to transfer in-kind
                contributions into unrestricted operating funds. In October, 2000 MissionFish began with a realization
                that:
                <br>

              <ul>
                <li>There are a lot of good people and companies that support nonprofits, and they have a lot of good
                  stuff that they want to give away.</li>
                <li>Most nonprofits can't use the things that those people and companies want to give.</li>
                <li>Nonprofits don't generally have the time, the people or the infrastructure for dealing with in-kind
                  gifts - even when they can use them.</li>
              </ul>
              MissionFish operates under the umbrella of the Points of Light Foundation with its own distinct identity,
              an impressive roster of officers, and yes a passionate mission. Leaders behind this cutting edge
              charitable foundation have mastered the art of partnering with like-minded companies and individuals.<br>
              <br>
              MissionFish easily established the &quot;mission&quot; part of their moniker. &quot;Fish,&quot; the second
              half of this impressive organization&#146;s name breathed new life into an insightful but overly familiar
              analogy. Bill Shore of Share Our Strength coined the phrase: &quot;giving someone a fish feeds them for a
              day, teaching them to fish feeds them for a lifetime.&quot; MissionFish takes a bold step forward and
              endeavors to provide nonprofits with a way to build &quot;fisheries,&quot; sustaining them perpetually. As
              a Fishery for nonprofit organizations, MissionFish provides a supportive environment for hatching funds
              and spawning a flow of revenue without significant financial expenditure or high-tech training.<br>
              <br>
              Sow&#146;s Ears and White Elephants translate beyond Silk Purses and Cash Cows in the capable hands of
              MissionFish. The odds of success were favorable for MissionFish&#146;s original concept, but no one could
              have predicted the countless lives that have benefited from their efforts. Their initial launch was as an
              independent online auction sight allowing donors to offer anything of value to their choice of nonprofit
              through MissionFish. Items useful to individual organizations were kept; the rest were turned into cash
              through the auction marketplace.<br>
              <br>

              Benefits abounded for all parties involved. Shoppers enjoyed buying quality merchandise, sometimes hard to
              find items, while supporting charitable causes. Nonprofits translated unusable in-kind donations into
              desperately needed operating revenue and donors received tax deductions for their generous
              contributions.<br>
              <br>
              It took less than two years for the founders of MissionFish to radically alter their organization&#146;s
              governing structure and financial status. MissionFish began as a for-profit company serving nonprofits in
              October of 2000. During the course of operation, they recognized the potential for increasing their
              accomplishments by restructuring the organization as a nonprofit. MissionFish became a service of the
              Points of Light Foundation in the Summer of 2002. Like minded individuals joined in a mutual effort to
              &quot;engage more people more effectively in volunteer community service to help solve serious social
              problems.&quot;<br>
              <br>
              The rest, as they say, is history. MissionFish launched &quot;Lunch with a Leader Online Auction,&quot; a
              high-profile and unbelievably successful fundraiser. Political figures, business leaders and A-list
              celebrities offered bidders a chance to vie for lunch with individuals they admired. The now annual event
              attracts the likes of <strong>First Lady Laura Bush</strong> (who also served as Honorary Chair for the
              event), <strong>Arnold Schwarzeneggar</strong>, <strong>Richard Petty</strong>, <strong>Pattie
                Labelle</strong> and former First Lady <strong>Rosalyn Carter</strong>. Last year&#146;s auction raised
              over $300,000 to benefit Communities In Schools.<br>
              <br>
              MissionFish has also managed blue-chip online charitable auctions like Ebids From The Heart benefiting the
              American Heart Association and online auctions for Sears, Roebuck and Co., The Oprah Winfrey Magazine
              &quot;O,&quot; and Coors Brewing Company among others.<br>
              <br>
              MissionFish&#146;s continuing support of charitable causes is riding a wave that has yet to crest.
              Nonprofits should be busy mending and stitching larger and stronger nets to accommodate operating funds
              swimming in their direction. If an old fisherman was telling the tale of MissionFish, it would be tempting
              to discount it as one more &quot;fish story.&quot; The reality is&#133;its all true. In a few short years,
              MissionFish has done all this and more. In very short order, a few ripples in the fundraising pool have
              resulted in a tidal wave of revenue for charitable causes.<br>

              Before our partnership with MissionFish, we generally considered an in-kind gift to be an unkind gift.
              MissionFish offers our organization a simple way to turn these donated goods into the revenue we need to
              reach the next child and the next community.<br>
              <br>
              <i><b>Chandler Arnold</b>, Director of Corporate Strategy, First Book</i><br>
              <br>
              It's the time of year when thoughts turn to giving-and figuring out what to do with those gifts you wish
              you hadn't been given. D.C.-based MissionFish understands. Think it's not worth donating that odd white
              elephant in your basement? Think again.<br>

              The MissionFish auction helped us promote Sears merchandise online, and support the Points of Light
              Foundation at the same time. This is one of the only cash-free cause-marketing programs that I've ever
              found, and the results far exceeded our best hopes.<br>

            <h4><strong>Fundraising Tips:</strong></h4>
            <h2><strong>iSOLDit: Charity Auctions Made Easy</strong></h2>
            <h4><strong>Merging Humanity and Technology through Altruistic eBay Applications</strong></h4>
            <p><img src="../../images/soldit.gif" style="float: left;" alt=""> Success, in both the private and
              nonprofit sectors, often springs from equal parts of pluck and luck. Admittedly, monopolizing on these
              elusive qualities takes a certain presence of mind. Elise Wetzel demonstrates her intuitive business
              skills with a cutting edge concept, iSOLD It, which makes raising funds easy for worthy causes.

            <p>iSOLD It catapulted to the head of a distinctive class of entrepreneurs searching for ways to work with
              Internet auctions instead of struggling against them. The idea of launching storefront locations for
              customers to drop-off items for auctioning on eBay had its genesis in a fundraising project for a
              playground at Wetzel's children's school. </p>
            <p>Her flagship iSOLD It storefront in Pasadena has been so successful that after only nine months of
              operation, 237 additional stores are scheduled to open under franchise contract agreements in the coming
              year. At least 50 of these locations will have their doors open for business by the end of 2004. </p>
            <p>Wetzel says, “I really think I've tapped into a service that a lot of people are looking for.” That
              service, as she sees it, is simplifying the selling process on eBay. “It's really easy to buy merchandise
              on Internet auctions like eBay, but it's complicated to sell.” </p>
            <p>The key to successful fundraising ideas is maximization of financial returns while minimizing the
              workload on understaffed nonprofit organizations. Wetzel believes iSOLD It fulfills that goal. “I see so
              many nonprofits holding rummage sales and I think this is a much better vehicle for maximizing their
              return on donated items. eBay has millions of regular users and this traffic means increased demand for
              the items being sold.” </p>
            <p><img src="../../images/siteshot2.jpg" style="float:right;" alt=""> The age old concept of “supply and
              demand” is addressed by Wetzel's concept. iSOLD It stores supply the staff and technology to sell goods
              where they are most in demand, securing top prices for donated items in the process. </p>
            <p>They've already partnered with local nonprofit groups and schools. Elementary schools in La Canada ,
              California held a drop-drive that raised several thousands of dollars for school programs pinched by
              ongoing budget cuts. </p>
            <p>Wetzel's business supplied organizational and marketing materials establishing the dates and locations of
              the drop-drive. This included six different days with three school drop locations and three drop locations
              within the community. The items collected were auctioned on eBay by iSOLD It at a discount commission
              rate, offered to all qualified nonprofit groups. </p>
            <p>“The beauty of this is you're turning fundraising upside down – you're not asking for money or a handout
              – you're just giving people a chance to get rid of things they're not using while supporting a cause
              that's important to them,” Wetzel says. </p>
            <p>Their website succinctly states: “iSOLD It now offers a completely innovative, extremely simple way to
              raise funds for your organization. Simply register your not-for-profit with iSOLD It to qualify for our
              discounted fundraising fee structure. Then, ask your network of supporters to drop by iSOLD It with items
              to sell on eBay (be sure to have them specify your organization as the recipient of the funds.” </p>
            <p>“Once an item sells, we'll send your organization a check! For even more impact, let iSOLD It help you
              organize a Drop Off Drive at your school or other location. We can provide the forms for you to use to
              collect items at a location of your choice.” </p>
            <p><img src="../../images/siteshot1.jpg" style="float:left; margin-right: 10px;" alt=""> One of the most
              important elements of a successful fundraising drive with iSOLD It is getting donors to drop-off desirable
              items that will garner high-dollar bids on eBay. Wetzel says, “It's important to educate people about what
              types of things sell well on eBay. We can search for comparable items that are selling at online auction
              sites to determine whether they'll generate high bids.” </p>
            <p>The iSold It website includes a list of popular items on eBay: Antiques and collectibles; Designer
              clothing, shoes and accessories; Electronics such as cameras, computers and stereo equipment; House wares;
              Tickets to sports events and concerts; Jewelry and watches; Entertainment memorabilia; Musical
              instruments; Sports equipment and memorabilia and Automotive parts and accessories. </p>
            <p><img src="../../images/items2.jpg" style="float: right;" alt=""> One of iSOLD It's memorable taglines
              advises nonprofits to “Turn Old Memories into New Money with iSOLD It.” Their website claims it's as easy
              as 1-2-3 . </p>
            <p>Number one: Drop it off. Personalized assistance makes it easy to leave your merchandise in the hands of
              professionals who will photograph and list individual items on eBay. </p>
            <p>Number two: Watch the action. “Once we've listed your item on eBay, we'll send you an email with a link
              to the auction, so that you can watch all the action as it occurs. Many of our sellers tell us this part
              is as fun as getting their final check.” </p>
            <p><img src="../../images/ring.jpg" style="float:left; margin-right: 10px;" alt=""> Number three: Collect
              your check. “After the item sells, we collect payment and professionally ship your item to the winning
              bidder. Once the transaction is complete, we send you a check. Or, if you prefer, we can send the proceeds
              to your favorite charity.” Wetzel says, “The turnaround - between dropping an item off and receiving a
              check - is typically within a thirty day period.” Unsold items can be picked up or donated to local
              charitable groups. </p>
            <p>Wetzel is excited to announce their first national partnership with “Adopt-A-Minefield.” “Most of our
              fundraising has been on a local level, this is our first national effort,” she says. She hopes an
              increased national presence from iSOLD It storefront openings will lead to expanding nonprofit
              partnerships with high-profile causes. </p>
            <p>iSOLD It storefronts are stylish and appealing. Their distinctive look was developed to make people who
              aren't comfortable with computers or selling online feel at-ease. “Our store design is bright, crisp,
              clean and inviting,” Wetzel says. </p>
            <p><img src="../../images/mail.jpg" style="float: right;" alt=""> Richard & Helene Chemel are part of the
              first wave of iSOLD It franchise stores expected to crest around the country in the next year. They are
              thrilled with the storefront concept for online auctions and dedicated to helping nonprofits make use of
              their service. Their first fundraising drive coincides with the Grand Opening of their iSOLD It storefront
              in Chatsworth , California this month. </p>
            <p>Richard Chemel knew former residents of The Friends of Cabrito House in Canoga Park , California . The
              Cabrito House is a men's recovery home that helps men get back to “a life worth living.” He says, “Letters
              were sent to their donor list notifying them that Cabrito House would be the first beneficiary of our
              store's Charity Program.” </p>
            <p>He explains, “This allowed us to encourage supporters to do some spring cleaning and identify unwanted
              items of value that will be auctioned off to support Cabrito House.” <br>
              <br>
              Helene Chemel adds, "Since we opened, I've been on the phone calling local schools and organizations to
              make them aware of our service. It's a great alternative to selling fundraising products.” <br>
              <br>
              "We believe that being part of the iSOLD It family and their initiative for fundraising in the local
              community is a great way for us to be able to give back - right in our own back yard." says Richard.

            <h4><strong>Featured Idea:</strong></h4>
            <h2> <strong>Selling Products: A Growing Trend Among Local Community Fundraisers</strong></h2>
            <p>What usually comes to mind when you think of a local community fundraiser? A bake sale, walk-a-thon,
              benefit dinner, a show or party... There's no question that these are great ways to raise funds for a
              cause, but they can involve a considerable amount of planning, and are usually best suited for
              organizations with a lot of volunteers. Smaller charitable organizations and local community groups have
              typically resorted to the old tradition of soliciting donations. Some will go door to door, others set up
              in a local mall or circulate a collection box at work</p>
            <p>But many charitable fundraisers are discovering another way to raise funds for local charitable causes as
              well as for local chapters of large non profits. For many years, schools and sports teams have been
              raising funds through the sales of a wide variety of items. If this works for schools, teams or scouting
              groups; why shouldn't it work to raise funds for a local chapter of a non profit or a national charity?
              Donors respond more with their wallet when they know that the money is going to support a cause. Of
              course, just helping out is a reward in itself, but getting something in return can fuel even more
              generosity. After all, we are all consumers at heart. It's only natural that fundraisers will have an
              easier time reaching more of us by selling products.</p>

            <p><img src="../../images/savingPeople.jpg" alt="" style="float: right;">

                target="clear">JustFundraising.com</a> is helping any interested group, to raise funds quickly and
              communicate inspirational messages, at a time when both are needed most with Hurricane Katrina Donation
              Cards. Whether you already have a group, or you're planning on creating one, JustFundraising.com wants to
              help and will provide these cards to approved groups, absolutely free of charge.<br>
              <br>
              JustFundraising.com is giving away a total of $45,000 worth of fundraising products to groups who are
              committed to helping raise funds for the Hurricane Katrina victims. Some groups that may be interested
              include sports teams, church groups, youth groups, schools, even companies.<br>
            </p>
            <h4><strong>
                How Does It Work?</strong></h4>
            <p>
            <ul>
              <li> <strong>Step 1:</strong> They will provide your group with up to 20 Hurricane Katrina Donation Cards
                (depending on the number of fundraising participants). Distribute 1 donation card to each of your
                fundraisers. Each donation card has 56 scratch dots.<br>
              </li>
              <li> <strong>Step 2:</strong> You will simply ask friends, neighbors, co-workers to scratch 1 or more
                dots, and to pay the total of the amounts they revealed ($0.50 to $3.00 per dot). Underneath each dot,
                there is also a positive inspirational message. *See examples below<br>
              </li>
              <li> <strong>Step 3:</strong> Accumulate all collected funds and write a check out to Unicef, Red Cross,
                or any other preferred non-profit organization dedicated to the Hurricane Katrina relief efforts.<br>
              </li>

            <p>These cards regularly sell for $15 each, but JustFundraising.com is providing them to committed groups,
              absolutely free of charge. With every 20 donation cards, groups can raise $2,300 for Hurricane Katrina
              relief efforts. JustFundraising.com is hoping to distribute up to 3,000 Hurricane Katrina Donation Cards,
              which could raise a total of $345,000.</p>

            <h2> <strong>Lunch Box Comics: A Healthy Fundraising Alternative</strong></h2>
            <h4><strong>Mindy Myers
                CEO, Sound Advice, Inc. <img src="../../images/MindyAndTalia2.jpg"
                  style="float: left;margin-right: 10px;" alt=""></strong></h4>
            <p>Does grilled ham and cheese on white bread, chips, cookies and soda ring a bell? That's because it's
              typical lunch fare for many school-aged children. Is it any wonder so many youngsters are overweight?</p>

            <p>According to the North American Association on the Study of Obesity, elementary school-aged children
              weigh10 pounds more than they did 40 years ago, on average. Teens are averaging a 10–16 pound increase
              during the same time period. Who is to blame for this surge of obesity? Many point the finger at working
              parents suffering from time limitations.</p>

            <p>“Making a school lunch is at the bottom of my list of things to do,” says Wendy Goldsby, a single,
              working mother from Oakland, CA. Her son is 12 years old. “I often don't get home until 7 p.m. I need to
              spend my time helping my son with his homework and doing chores. I grab whatever's convenient and throw it
              in my son's lunchbox, even though I know it's not the healthiest.”</p>

            <p>Wendy, like many other mothers, often reaches for a quick solution to the school lunch dilemma:
              pre-packaged foods like chips, cheese or peanut butter crackers and cookies. These foods are high in fat
              and low in fiber and nutrition.</p>

            <p><img src="../../images/sample5.jpg" style="float:right;" alt=""> Moms like Wendy Goldsby consider Healthy
              Eating and Exercise comics an antidote to America's fast food craze. “I read each Healthy Eating and
              Exercise comic before placing it in my son's lunchbox,” she says, acknowledging that the comics have had
              an influence on her as well as her son. “I now find myself choosing low-fat and whole-grain foods when I'm
              in the supermarket.”</p>

            <p>Colorful wrappers and packaging that lure unsuspecting children towards unhealthy foods often feature
              recognizable characters from Saturday morning cartoons. Gullible children are drawn to the foods that
              become associated with fun. Food content becomes secondary, and that's when Mindy Myers, CEO of Sound
              Advice, decided to create NoteNiks.</p>

            <p>Mindy says “I felt it was my duty, as a parent, to direct and guide my son at all times. Of course it
              wasn't practical or even possible to offer guidance while he was away at school. That's when I came up
              with the idea of a school lunch-time message that promotes healthy eating, exercise, and wellness.”</p>

            <p>Changing a culture that reveres fast food and candy may seem impossible, yet the fundraising community
              can impact the growing obesity problem. Organizations aren't restricted to selling items without social
              value. They can opt for alternative, healthy fundraising products. It's possible - even admirable - to
              raise funds WHILE positively impacting children's lives.</p>

            <p> <img src="../../images/sample2.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" alt=""> Lunchbox Comic Pads
              make an excellent fundraising item for schools, churches and family-related organizations and nonprofits.
              Priced at only $4 per pad retail, Sound Advice offers an attractive wholesale and fundraising pricing
              structure for fundraising campaigns. It also makes perfect sense to offer products that are beneficial to
              youngsters when fundraising for a charitable cause that's related to children.</p>

            <p>Each pack of Healthy Eating & Exercise comics contains 32 different notes. Orders for 5,000 or more
              NoteNiks allow organizations to custom print information on the header and back panel. A charity's name,
              contact information, event calendar and any other pertinent information receive star-billing with this
              customized option.</p>

            <p>Each comic includes affirmative messages. Topics include: portion control, choosing water over soda,
              healthy snacks, getting enough exercise, the influence of body image by the media and many others. Moms
              are encouraged to place a comic in their child's lunchbox each day. The notes serve to remind children to
              make healthy choices and offers solutions to the barrage of fat-filled and sugary food temptations. The
              comics also serve to educate parents who are influential in their children's eating habits.</p>

            <p> <img src="../../images/comics.jpg" style="float: right;" alt=""> Using comics to guide and advise
              children while they are at school originated with LunchBox NoteNiks, Mindy's first comic note pad product.
              The LunchBox NoteNiks for kids ages 4 - 7 stress the importance of family; the lunchBox NoteNiks for kids
              ages 8 - 12 help kids grapple with bullying, teasing, friendship making, and other growing up issues.</p>

            <p>The education industry and back-to-school markets immediately welcomed LunchBox NoteNiks as a unique
              educational product with social value. When the concept and products were applied to school fundraising,
              the response was overwhelming. Parents who were tired of buying wrapping paper and subscribing to
              magazines opened their wallets for the groundbreaking product that positively impacts a child's life.</p>

            <p>Karen Kolligs, Fundraising Co-Chair for Tehiyah Day School in El Cerrito, California, says, “We used
              LunchBox NoteNiks as one of our fundraisers last year. Parents loved the idea of buying something that
              could positively affect their child's behavior.”</p>

            <p>Tehiyah Day School raised over two thousand dollars from sales, which enabled the school to buy much
              needed library books and supplies.</p>

            <p> <img src="../../images/notenicks.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" alt=""> Karen adds, “I
              bought three packs of LunchBox NoteNiks for my son. At first, I thought the comics would be a cute lunch
              box surprise, but over the weeks I saw a change in my son's behavior. I think the comic messages were
              really affecting him.”</p>

            <p>LunchBox NoteNiks soon paved the way for the creation of Medi-NoteNiks. This new line of lunch-time
              comics was specifically designed for children with medical and behavioral conditions that need extra
              emotional support. As with the LunchBox NoteNiks, Medi-NoteNiks comics are placed in a child's lunchbox as
              a way to support a newly diagnosed child.</p>

            <p>Every child experiences the rollercoaster of growing up, but kids with medical or behavioral problems
              have twice as many hurdles to overcome. Medi-NoteNiks are comic notes that acknowledge the emotional
              baggage that often accompanies these differences.</p>

            <p>Mindy says, “Medi-NoteNiks for kids with Asthma was the first Medi-NoteNiks pack I created. My youngest
              child has asthma and there were many nights when I listened to her cry about being embarrassed to take
              medication in front of friends and feel ashamed of carrying her inhaler around. The comic notes served to
              normalize the condition and made her feel like she wasn't the only one with asthma. The notes also helped
              her to be mindful to cover her mouth on a cold day, keep away from smoke and stay indoors after the lawn
              was freshly mowed.</p>

            <p>After learning that Attention Deficit Disorder in elementary-school-aged children has increased 700%
              since 1990, I created a pack of Medi-NoteNiks for kids with ADD/ADHD. These notes were designed to work in
              conjunction with medication, psychological intervention and parental support.”</p>

            <p><img src="../../images/sample4.jpg" style="float: right;" alt=""> The goal of Medi-NoteNiks for kids with
              ADD/ADHD was to help a child who is trying to manage his focus problems, distractibility issues, and
              behavior problems. The fun and supportive comic notes help children understand their limitations. They
              also empower frustrated parents who, until now, have had few tools to help them intervene in their child's
              treatment.</p>

            <p>Comics for children with pediatric diabetes and cancer are slated for Spring of 2005. For more

            <h4><strong>About Mindy</strong></h4>

            <p>When individuals recognize a problem in their society, they respond in many different ways. Some turn a
              blind eye; others join organizations that operate on local, regional and national levels to address the
              issue. A few pioneering personalities, like this month's “Person Behind the Cause,” launch their own
              companies and place personal fingerprints on a variety of causes.</p>

            <p>Mindy Myers founded Sound Advice, Inc. and began producing NoteNiks – comic note products – in response
              her son's ADD diagnosis and her daughter's asthmatic condition. Her personal concerns now encompass a
              variety of children's health issues with corresponding products offered to fundraisers across the country.
            </p>

            <p>Juvenile obesity and diabetes is covered along with preventative oral hygiene. Attention deficit disorder
              and asthma were a natural and the product line continues to expand through client input and Mindy's
              creative brainstorming.</p>

            <p>The most striking element of NoteNiks is their ability to address physical, medical, emotional and
              psychological issues in a way that children are receptive to. The response from clinicians and medical
              professionals has been overwhelmingly positive. Mindy's background was perfect preparation for this
              endeavor.</p>

            <p>She earned her master's degree in Education with a focus on Child Development from Mills College in CA,
              and is a doctoral candidate at Saybrook Graduate School where she is studying Educational Systems Design.
              She is also a past Editor of Parents Magazine. Mindy lives in Oakland, California, with her husband and
              children.</p>

            <p><img src="../../images/Lindaheadshot.jpg" style="float: right;" alt=""> <b>Linda Hymes and Derek
                Gaffney</b> have created a fundraising opportunity like no other. They are saut&eacute;ing, simmering,
              pirouetting and pas des deuxing a path to charitable causes close to their hearts. <i>The Dancing Gourmet:
                Recipes to Keep You on Your Toes</i>, is a cookbook that has won prestigious awards and is now available
              to non-profit groups looking to match the product with the passion.</p>

            <p>A classically trained, professional ballet dancer, <b>Linda Hymes</b> has spent a lifetime keeping a
              close eye on her tutu'd waistline. Her love of healthy gourmet dining has led to a second career as a
              chef; trained at none other than <i>Le Cordon Blue Ecole de Cuisine</i> in London, England. She refuses to
              sacrifice sumptuous flavor or picturesque presentation in pursuit of naturally healthy food.</p>

            <p>Hymes' husband, <b>Derek Gaffney</b>, is an accomplished photographer and sculptor. His photographs of
              her classically inspired appetizers, entrees, and desserts garnered two Gourmand food photography awards
              this year. <i>The Dancing Gourmet Cookbook</i> won a Gold Medal for Best Photography/Illustration
              (English/USA). It also received a Silver Medal for Food Photography in the World; chosen from 3,500
              entries published in 33 languages, representing 60 countries.</p>

            <p>These formidable partners have captured center stage and remain standing for ovations that continue to
              pour in. <i>The Dancing Gourmet</i> was recently honored with the ForeWord Cookbook of the Year Award.
              Accolades have been sprinkled throughout prominent food and dance publications. <i>Cooking Light
                Magazine</i>, Le Cordon Bleu's head chef, and New York City Ballet's Principal Dancer, Judith Fugate,
              all rave about Hymes and Gaffney's unique approach. Hymes also writes a regular food column for <i>Pointe
                Magazine</i>.</p>

            <p><a href="bears.html" target="_top"><img src="../../images/honey.jpg"
                  style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" alt=""></a> The combination of performing and culinary arts
              extends to health-conscious recipes and atmospheric black and white photos of Linda Hymes in traditional
              ballet poses. The same dual sensibilities were the inspiration behind a recent foray into fundraising. In
              efforts to promote and support dance training, performance, and appreciation, <i>The Dancing Gourmet
                Cookbook</i> is available to non-profit groups of all sizes.</p>

            <p>Fundraising efforts are customized for cheerleading squads, dance troupes, ballet studios, jazz and tap
              students, and other groups struggling to fund their artistic endeavors. A recent press release says, "The
              cookbook can be sold through redeemable postcard mailers, student book drives, patron mailings, summer
              program and competition favors and corporate sales and matching grants."</p>

            <p><img src="../../images/Poached-pear.jpg" alt="" style="float:right; "><i>The Dancing Gourmet</i> can
              initiate a fundraising drive by providing marketing tools and handling distribution. Rewards are offered
              for outstanding fundraising efforts. They can include one or more of the following: A free master class or
              cooking demonstration, and/or a private book signing in individual schools and dance studios.</p>

            <p><i>Dancing Gourmet</i> cookbooks sold through direct mail fundraising can be personalized and signed by
              Linda Hymes for individual purchasers. The quality of the publication guarantees satisfaction from patrons
              and encourages support for the arts and healthy options for young dancers concerned about nutrition.</p>

            <p>Hymes and Gaffney donate a portion of their own profits to a scholarship fund through <i>Career
                Transition for Dancers</i>. They also actively support National Dance Week with their professional
              expertise, personal appearances, and financial contributions.</p>

            <p> <img src="../../images/signing-and-demo-Gourmet-Pr.jpg" style="float:left; margin-right: 10px;" alt="">
              This is an auspicious beginning, whetting our appetites for upcoming efforts by <i>The Dancing
                Gourmet</i>. Hymes has recently participated in book signing events at theatrical and dance gatherings.
              She also had the honor of introducing Jamie Oliver, the <i>Naked Chef</i>, for a recent promotional
              appearance at the Palo Alto Borders Book Store. Her recent celebrity guest demonstrations were highlights
              at the <i>San Francisco Gourmet Product Show</i> and the <i>Sacramento Food and Wine Show</i>. Gaffney and
              Hymes coordinate their cookbook and fundraising efforts nationwide with Illinois Theatrical Dance
              Distributor and activities in the San Francisco Bay Area, where they reside.</p>

            <p>A new cookbook is simmering for next year: <i>The Nutcracker Sweet</i>. It will focus on desserts; many
              inspired by the perennial ballet classic. <i>The Dancing Gourmet</i> hopes to have the cookbook ready
              prior to the next holiday season. This should provide a stunning centerpiece for holiday fundraising
              efforts.</p>

                Dandy Don's Homemade Ice Cream Resourceful Fundraising with a Cherry on Top!</strong></h2>
            <p> <img src="../../images/daddy don.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" alt=""> Fundraising
              resources come in many forms. Recent articles at Fundraisers.Com
              have focused on beneficial technological and information
              resources. This
              month we offer a slightly more homespun flavor in our resource area.or
              should we say 101 different flavors. Yes, it's time to get savvy about
              the finer points of adding an ice cream social to your local fundraising
              event. </p>
            <p>Dandy Don
              is a connoisseur of hot fudge, caramel sauce, crushed nuts, sliced strawberries,
              rainbow sprinkles and maraschino cherries - delicately dancing atop
              dazzling ice cream sundaes. Scooping, serving, and sprinkling may not
              be aerobic activities, but Dandy Don's Homemade Ice Cream & Sundae Bar
              Catering maintains a frenetic pace while working with small and large
              charitable organizations alike. </p>
            <p>Make-A-Wish-Foundation,
              Special Olympics, Red Cross, Children's Hospital of Los Angeles, Cystic
              Fibrosis Foundation, Starlight Children's Foundation and Boys and Girls
              Clubs are some of the larger groups Dandy Don has dished with. He's
              also helped smaller groups in Southern California scoop up extra fundraising
              funds with ice cream sundae bars at charitable events. They include
              the Friends of Robinson Garden, LA Shanti, and the Club Culinaire Francais.

            <p> <img src="../../images/shop.gif" style="float: right;" alt=""> Charity
              auctions, tasting events, and fundraising dinners are examples of
              venues where ice cream adds that extra sprinkling of fun. After
              all, they didn't coin the phrase "Ice Cream Socials" for no reason.
              Sundae bars bring out the inner child in attendees at black tie suppers
              and more casual charity events. Scoops of ice cream drizzled with
              toppings, whipped cream and a cherry makes everyone a little
              more..social. </p>
            <p>Dandy
              Don offers tips from years of experience in his for-profit business
              and a winning record of partnerships with charitable organizations.
              Don says, "You can easily sell a two ounce ice cream sundae - half
              the size of four ounce sundaes from ice cream parlors - for $2.00
              or more at fundraising events." Supporters of charities don't mind
              the price because proceeds are going to a worthy cause.</p>
            <p> Don adds,
              "I always recommend collecting the money in advance. It helps project
              what you really need on hand for attendees. You can lose money by buying
              more than you can sell." He repeats his advice again for added emphasis,
              "Never do it on 'spec.' Always pre-sell the event."</p>
            <p> Partnering
              with a local ice cream shop is a great way to go according to Dandy
              Don. "You can usually get the ice cream shop to promote the event along
              with your organization so you're getting double coverage." Ice cream
              retailers may offer their products at cost or if you're really lucky
              they'll donate some or all of the ingredients for an ice cream sundae
              bar.</p>
            <p> <img src="../../images/lolipops.gif" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" alt=""> Adding
              an "ala mode" option to bake sales can also increase sales by fifty
              cents an item. Don says, "Charging fifty cents for a scoop of vanilla
              ice cream on a slice of pie or a piece of cake can increase profits
              at bake sales which are always great money makers." </p>
            <p>Don does
              have some basic advice for those wishing to get supporters screaming
              for ice cream. He advises, "Don't buy the big three gallon containers
              at food warehouses. By the time you get to the bottom the ice cream
              will be melted and messy." It's that old penny-wise and pound-foolish
              caution. "Most large retailers carry ice cream in five quart containers.
              This size is your best bet for profitability and ease of service,"
              he says. </p>
            <p>"You also
              need to have plenty of volunteers on hand to scoop. The fewer hands
              scooping the greater your chance of melting ice cream," according to
              Dandy Don. He adds, "When it's possible, I try to pre-scoop ice cream
              into individual bowls. Teams of two per tub work well. The bowls can
              be stacked in large ice chests and brought out as needed." Pre-scooped
              bowls of ice cream need to be refrozen for two - three hours before
              serving. Don says to plan your time accordingly. </p>
            <p>Dandy Don
              urges EXTREME caution when handling dry ice. "Only adults who are thoroughly
              skilled with handling dry ice should go near it. NEVER let children
              come in contact with dry ice." Curiosity can tempt even adults to touch
              or taste dry ice. "Second and third degree burns can happen quickly.
              Handling dry ice is like handling fire," Don says. When in doubt, don't
              use it. Ice and dry ice should be placed on top of ice cream in coolers.
              "Remember, cold air falls and hot air rises," he adds. </p>
            <p> <img src="../../images/icecreammain.gif" style="float: right;" alt=""> You
              can expect to get approximately 30 scoops out of a five quart container.
              Plexiglass containers or large ice chests can usually be found at
              party rental agencies. "Keep in mind the sun will always be an issue
              for outdoor summer events using ice cream. If possible, toppings are best served under a
              cover of shade, as most toppings melt at 80&deg;F.

              During the summer, always hold ice cream events indoors," Dandy
              Don advises. </p>
            <p>Hot fudge
              isn't always practical for ice cream sundae bars. Don says squeeze bottles
              of chocolate sauce usually cure the chocolate craving. He also says
              buying packages of cookies and candy bars and crushing them yourself
              is a money saver. "Rainbow sprinkles are more popular than the chocolate
              ones and you can find them in most candy aisles," according to Don,
              "Whipped cream in cans is a also good bet."</p>
            <p>For that
              gourmet touch, fresh fruit can be sliced on site. In Don's experience,
              "People love to see the food being prepared. Any kind of fresh fruit
              can be sliced right at the ice cream bar." Strawberries, kiwis and bananas
              are popular choices. </p>
            <p> <img src="../../images/smDonheadshot.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" alt=""> If
              there's a large&nbsp;ice cream distributor in your area, they may
              offer a mobile freezing unit for serving ice cream novelties&nbsp;at
              local fundraising events. If not, dry ice can be used to keep novelties
              frozen prior to being purchased by attendees as fundraisers.</p>

              for meeting your group's fundraising goals are an important gesture

              community. Most of the groups Dandy Don's serves for achieving their
              goals are advised, early on, that their reward will be a Hot Fudge Sundae
              Bar with all the trimmings. </p>
            <p>Don says
              he always serves his 'Top Ten Toppings' at thank you parties for hardworking
              fundraisers. Young people recognize the generosity of this reward because
              they eat sundaes regularly and know the cost of extra special toppings.
            </p>
            <p>Hard workers
              who made or exceeded their goals know that their ultimate sundae vision
              will be a reality when the community's goal is met. Don says, "Next
              time, give your best winning effort more than just another pizza. Always
              let the kids put lots of toppings on their sundae!" He adds, "They earned
              their reward. If they do over indulge, they might learn that too much
              of a good thing (especially sweet treats) requires moderation." </p>

            <p>The successful

              access to a wealth of opportunities linked to their geographic location,
              age range, passion for particular causes, and hours of availability
              for service. VolunteerMatch 's corporate services provides over 20 companies
              with a far more efficient method of maximizing corporate volunteering
              efforts.
            </p>
            <p>“VolunteerMatch
              is designed to make it easier than ever for anyone to find a rewarding
              way to volunteer,” said Jason Willett, director of communications
              for VolunteerMatch. “We succeed because our community is made
              up of a network of nonprofit, volunteer and business leaders committed
              to civic engagement.”

              community: Volunteers, Community Service Groups, Corporate Partnerships.
              The simplicity of the idea and the development of powerful software
              have been the keys to VolunteerMatch's success. Their website is amazingly
              easy to navigate. It includes an evolving list of elements used to narrow
              a potential volunteers search for opportunities to work <img src="../../images/search.gif"
                style="float: right;">with

        <h2><strong>Ideas For How To Form A Tax-Exempt Nonprofit Corporation</strong></h2>
        <h4><strong>Guest Article By Alon Nager, Legal Counsel for Grassroots.org<br></strong></h4>
        <h6><strong>Introduction</strong></h6>
        
        <p>
        
          Starting a nonprofit corporation is not as difficult as you may think.  With the right tools, ideas, structure and support, forming a nonprofit should be a piece of cake.  That is not to say that the process isn't time consuming.  Many hours must be devoted to the process of making your organization official and tax-exempt.  Before deciding whether to proceed with the process, you may first want to consider the advantages and disadvantages.<br>
          <br>
          <img src="../../images/legal.jpg" style="float: right;">
          There are important advantages to forming a nonprofit corporation.  First, you are eligible to apply for and receive federal and state tax exemption.  These exemptions can save your organization hundreds or thousands of dollars every year.  Second, you may apply for and receive many public and private donations which are not available to other types of organizations or individuals.  Third, corporate status will protect you and others against personal liability should a lawsuit ensue.  Fourth, your organization will possess a separate and perpetual legal existence with formality and structure.<br>
          <br>
          Forming a nonprofit corporation also has its disadvantages.  First, there is a lot of paperwork involved in forming the corporation, filing for tax-exemption and keeping in line with annual reporting requirements.  Second, the government charges various costs and fees to incorporate and file for tax-exempt status.  Third, much time and energy is required to run the business.  Fourth, there are various restrictions imposed upon dissolution, namely, you cannot distribute any profit to board members.  Fifth, there are restrictions placed on your organization's activities.  For example, you can only focus a small amount of your efforts on political activities.  Finally, you are always subject to oversight by the Attorney General of state.<br>
          <br>
          When forming a non-profit corporation, there are some extra steps involved.  In addition to preparing and filing incorporation documents, paying filing fees and electing board members, you must apply for tax-exempt status with the IRS and your state's taxing body.  This issue is discussed in more detail later in the article.  For now we should consider the purposes for which you may form a nonprofit.<br>
      </p>
      <h4><strong>Nonprofit vs For-Profit</strong></h4>
      <p>
          <img src="../../images/grassrootslogo.jpg" style="float:left;" alt="">
              Nonprofit corporations differ significantly from for-profit corporations in several ways.  Nonprofit corporations are formed pursuant to different state law than for-profit corporations.  Due to this fact, the requirements for incorporation, day-to-day operations, reporting requirements and handling of finances will all differ.  The two types of organization also differ in what they are allowed to try and accomplish.<br>
              <br>
              Unlike for-profit corporations, which are generally formed for "any lawful purpose", nonprofit corporations must be formed to accomplish one or more specific purposes. These purposes typically benefit either the general public, part of the community, or a particular group of members.  Typically, a tax-exempt nonprofit group must be formed to pursue educational, charitable, scientific, religious, literary, or cultural goals.   Only these groups will gain exemption under section 501(c)(3) of the IRS code.<br>
              <br>
              In other exceptional cases a group can be formed for other purposes yet still be eligible for tax-exempt status.  Public schools, libraries, and other government organizations also qualify as public charities, although they usually have not applied for 501(c)(3) status.  There are other sections of the code which provide for different exemptions for organizations with different structures and purposes.<br>
      </p>
      <h4><strong>Starting Your Nonprofit</strong> </h4>
      <p>
          <img src="../../images/legalgavel.jpg" style="float: right;">
          Incorporating your nonprofit will be a time consuming and sometimes tedious process, but will be rewarding if you do it right. Use the following information to guide you through the process, making sure that you complete all the steps:
      </p>
      <h6><strong>1) Visit your Secretary of State's website to receive valuable information and materials</strong></h6>
      <p>
          First, decide which state you want to incorporate in.  Most nonprofits incorporate in the state where their principal place of business is located.  Next, contact the secretary of state from the state you choose.  (To see a list of Secretary of State web sites go to this site.)   Some states provide an "Articles of Incorporation" form and pertinent state statutes that will help you create your bylaws and other important corporate documents.</p>
          <h6><strong>2) Choose and protect your corporate name</strong></h6>
          <p>
              This step is critical because your name will be used in your stationery, business cards, contracts, etc. You also want to make sure that you pick a name that conveys to others what you hope to achieve through your nonprofit.  Remember that your name is the first thing that the community, business partners and grant agencies will see.
          <br><br>
          
This step is critical because your name will be used in your stationery, business cards, contracts, etc. You also want to make sure that you pick a name that conveys to others what you hope to achieve through your nonprofit.  Remember that your name is the first thing that the community, business partners and grant agencies will see.
<br><br>

There are a couple of other legal requirements to watch out for in choosing your corporate name.  First, many states require you to use a corporate designator such as Incorporated, Company, Corporation, etc.  Second, some states prohibit the use of certain words in a nonprofit's corporate name.  Contact your secretary of state, research state statutes, or simply contact Grassroots.org  for help with creating your corporate name.
</p>

<h4><strong>3) Draft and file the articles of incorporation</strong></h4>
      <p><img src="../../images/legalbooks.jpg" alt="" style="float:left; margin-right: 10px;">
          The "Articles of Incorporation" document is your primary incorporation document and must be carefully drafted and reviewed. The filing of this paperwork with the Secretary of State, which generally costs between $100 and $200, triggers the beginning of your organization's existence. For guidance on how to draft and file the Articles of Incorporation please review the materials provided to you from your Secretary of State as well as the relevant state statutes. If you use another corporation's articles as your model, please be sure to follow state law and tailor the articles to your organizational needs. Simply copying the articles from another source can have harmful consequences.
          <br>
      <br>Once you have completed the articles, it is a good idea to have it reviewed by a legal professional. For qualifying Grassroots.org members, we will review your legal incorporation documents at no charge. For more information please contact Grassroots.org.</p> 
  <h6>4) Prepare bylaws for your nonprofit</h6>
  <p>
      
The bylaws are central to the way your corporation will be organized and operate.   The bylaws set forth the procedures for holding meetings and elections, resolving disputes, managing corporate operations, insuring corporate heads, etc.  The bylaws also contain blanket tax provisions applicable to tax-exempt nonprofit corporations.
<br><br>

It is imperative as with the articles that the bylaws are not treated as a meaningless, tedious legal requirement.   The bylaws will dictate how your organization functions and in turn what it becomes in the future.  For this reason alone, you should make sure that you understand what each provision means and what its effect is on the corporation.  You must also be careful to follow state law.
<br>

  </p>  
  <h6><strong>5) Apply for federal tax exemption</strong></h6>
  <p>
      The final step in the incorporation process will be filing for tax-exempt status with the IRS.   This is a very important step in that a favorable decision may exempt your organization from paying corporate income tax, may give donors tax incentives and may also provide you with other tax relief.  Tax-exempt status will also allow your organization to apply for grant money.  
Please note that you should be timely in your filing. You should file within 27 months after you file your articles of incorporation.  Do not procrastinate! There are many pitfalls if you file late.<BR>

Before you begin your application, be aware that the entire process will take an average of 12 hours to complete.   The IRS estimates that it takes about 4 hours just to familiarize yourself with the complicated forms.<BR>

When you are ready to begin:<BR>


a) Go to the IRS exemption organization information page.<BR>

b) Search for the applicable form (all forms require Adobe Acrobat reader on your machine):
Form 1023 for 501c3 charitable, scientific, religious, educational, or literary purposes
Form 1024 for most other purposes<BR>

c) Open the appropriate form on your computer and complete the forms.
If you are having trouble filling out the forms, determining which form to use, or wish to have your forms reviewed by our team, please apply for our free legal consulting program.<BR>

6)  Appoint the initial directors and hold the first meeting of the board<BR>

7)  Obtain any licenses and permits that are required<BR>

  </p>
  <h4><strong>Conclusion</strong>
  </h4>
  <p>
<img src="../../images/legalscale.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;">
      Once you have completed the steps listed above you have successfully incorporated your nonprofit and applied for 501c3 status.   In most cases your 501c3 status will be granted so long as you completed the forms correctly and your organization's purpose is indeed a "charitable" one.  The process of incorporating can seem tedious, time-consuming and difficult at times, but it is definitely worthwhile in the long run for a successful organization.<br>
      <br>
      Following incorporation there are still many tasks that one must become familiar with, such as filing tax returns, employment taxes, preparing minutes of corporate meetings, handling charitable donations, etc.  If you wish to speak with a professional about issues pertaining to the operation of a nonprofit, please apply for our free legal consulting program.<br>

Uppercuts to under-funding, left hooks to outdated software and right jabs to archaic computer equipment have been accomplished through impressive corporate partnerships.</p>

                               products and services. They are available to qualifying organizations 
                               for a nominal administrative fee (that includes shipping, handling, 
                               and live customer support). Because product providers place their own 
                               restrictions on eligibility, terms of use vary accordingly.</p>

    <h2><strong>Lennon Legacy Lives On With A Little Help From Many Friends</strong></h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        <img src="../../images/jisco tour bus.gif" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" alt="">
        What do you get when you cross an international cultural icon, an altruistic desire to provide musical inspiration to students, and a school bus outfitted with state of the art, multi-media recording equipment? The <strong>John Lennon Educational Tour Bus</strong>, of course. Throw in a songwriting contest with prizes totaling over $250,000, heavy hitters as corporate sponsors and music giants as judges and you&#146;ve got a phenomenal vehicle for creating musical sparks in students and building a bonfire of public awareness for music literacy.</p>

<p> <img src="../../images/Back-studio-2-(3).jpg" style="float: right;" alt=""> The <strong>John Lennon Educational Tour Bus</strong> has been touring public and private schools, colleges and universities, community organizations, Boys and Girls Clubs, concerts and music festivals since 1998. Students and other visitors are given an opportunity to gain hands-on experience with cutting edge recording equipment, video production facilities, high quality traditional and electronic instruments&#133;all for free.</p>

<p>It doesn&#146;t end with an incredible opportunity to play with gadgets that are usually reserved for the upper echelon of professional musicians. Schools and community groups are invited to apply to schedule a visit via e-mail using the link on the top left of this page.</p>

<p><strong>Elton John</strong>, <strong>Carlos Santana</strong>, <strong>Amy Grant</strong>, <strong>Jellybean Benitez</strong>, <strong>Michael W. Smith</strong>, <strong>Wyclef Jean</strong>, <strong>Black Eyed Peas</strong>, <strong>Dave Koz</strong>, and <strong>Sugar Ray</strong> are just a sampling of the illustrious list of musicians who serve on the Executive Committee of the John Lennon Songwriting Contest. They&#146;ve demonstrated their commitment to the project by stopping by and working with the kids; placing the term &quot;hands-on&quot; in a literal context.</p>

<p> <img src="../../images/Front-studio.jpg" style="margin-right: 10px; float: left;" alt=""> Generous support from <strong>Maxell, Yamaha, NAMM, EMI, Discmakers</strong>, and <strong>MusiciansFriend.com</strong>, among others, provides operating funds and prizes for the John Lennon Songwriting Contest and Educational Bus.</p>

<p>Operating as a non-profit program, this mobile facility is decked out with two distinctly different recording studios. The traditional arrangement is located in the back of the bus and has the capability of recording concerts and special events in addition to on board recording. An impressive selection of string instruments, percussion equipment and multiple keyboards are paired with a powerful, on-board public announcement system that allows fledgling musicians, as well as celebrities, to stage performances outside the John Lennon Bus.</p>

<p>The multi-media studio is located in the front portion of the John Lennon Bus. It is set up for audio/video equipment demonstrations, manned by professional technicians and provides an opportunity for visitors to assist in the recording and editing process. Participating students exit the bus with a Maxell DVD of the music video of their experience. Each original composition is written, performed, accompanied, recorded, videotaped and edited by musical novices with the assistance of three on board engineers who travel with the Bus.</p>

<p> <img src="../../images/entire-Bus.jpg" style="float: right; "  alt=""> Each year the John Lennon Bus makes over 150 stops at schools, concerts and community organizations. Over 60,000 miles are racked up on the odometer, annually. The powerhouse combination of an instantly recognizable, iconic namesake, generous corporate sponsorship and an amazingly dedicated, talented and charitable group of musicians and technicians keep feet tapping and lips humming across the country. Putting songs in the hearts of students is a huge step in opening their ears and eyes to other learning opportunities.</p>

<p>The <strong>John Lennon Educational Tour Bus</strong> proudly debuted its $300,000 renovation on January 15th at the 2004 NAMM Winter Conference in Anaheim, California. Technological improvements have sharpened the already cutting edge facilities. In 2003 alone, the Bus generated over 674 million exposures. This year, stops have been added at U.S. Stateside Military Bases allowing children of service personnel an opportunity to participate.</p>

<p><strong>Yoko Ono Lennon</strong> retains a close connection with the program bearing her late husband&#146;s name and it is with her permission that John Lennon&#146;s name and likeness is being used. She says, &quot;John would have been very excited about this project. It&#146;s exactly the kind of thing he wanted to happen.&quot;</p>

  <h2><strong>Cause Marketing: Partner Your Campaign With Business</strong></h2>
  <div>
    <p><img src="../../images/cause_marketing_logo.gif" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" alt=""> Corporate investment in cause marketing partnerships could hit $1 billion this year and Cause Marketing Forum, Inc., is doing a great deal to educate individuals and organizations about this powerful partnering strategy.</p>
<p>A novice can begin with articles as basic as Cause Marketing 101 while seasoned professionals can tap into more advanced materials related to marketing a cause with the help of a business partner.</p>
<p> <img src="../../images/David-Hesse.gif" style="float: right;" alt=""> &#8220;Cause marketing is the development of mutually-beneficial marketing relationships between companies and causes,&#8221; explained David Hessekiel, founder and president of CMFI.</p>
<p>The &quot;mutually beneficial&quot; element of cause marketing is behind their explosive popularity around the globe. Businesses and corporations can distinguish themselves from competitors, increase visibility and sales through successfully promoting awareness about worthy causes. Their images are burnished by demonstrating responsible &quot;citizenship&quot; through giving back to communities. Depending on the nature of the partnership, nonprofit causes can receive benefits such as funding, media coverage or advertising time that they could not have budgeted for on their own.</p>
<p>How important is cause marketing in the corporate and nonprofit sectors today? According to Carol Cone and her colleagues at Cone, Inc., their 2001 study asked the core question: &quot;Price and quality being equal, would you be likely to switch brands if the other brand were associated with a good cause? In October 2001, 81% of respondents said they would be likely to switch - a record score!&quot; These results demonstrate an increasing expectation of responsible corporate citizenship.</p>
<p>Individuals and organizations can educate themselves through a wide spectrum of offerings in the free CMF Resource Center at www.causemarketingforum.com. The variety of practical information, professional recognition, and hands-on training offered manages to bridge the gap between beginners and masterful practitioners of the art of marketing a cause.</p>
<p> <img src="../../images/halo-final-.gif" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" alt=""> The website also provides information on upcoming CMF programs such as the annual Cause Marketing Forum Conference and Workshops. The 2004 conference will be held June 15 - 17, 2004, at The Yale Club in New York City.</p>
<p>This summer CMF will launch a series of year-round teleclasses ranging from introductory courses to live interviews with the world&#8217;s leading cause marketers.</p>
<p>Until very recently, public recognition for impressive cause marketing campaigns was very limited. The Cause Marketing Halo Awards changed all that. They were inaugurated last year by the Cause Marketing Forum and were commemorated in a special section of Advertising Age magazine.</p>

<p>
  <div style="display: flex;flex-direction: column; width: 40%; float:right;"> 
    <img src="../../images/Halo-Award.gif" style="float: right;" alt="">
 <p class="text-center" style="font-size: 12px;"> Halo Award judges from left to
  right: Donna Feiner of the Ad Council, Patricia Lippe Davis of Good Housekeeping, David Hessekiel of Cause Marketing Forum, Sheila Charton of amfAR, Susan Arnot Heany of The Avon Foundation, and Stu Seltzer of Marketing on Demand.</p></p>
  </div>
 <p>  This year the award categories are Best Transactional Program, Best Joint Message Program, Best Health-Related Program, Best Environmental/Wildlife Program, Best Social Service/Education Program, Best Cause Marketing Print Creative, and Best Cause Marketing Event. In addition, each year CMF honors one corporation and one nonprofit with the Cause Marketing Golden Halo Award to recognize a record of excellence and leadership in the field. Last year the winners were the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation and General Mills. This year the awards go to the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America and American Express. </p></p>
<p>&#8220;Cause marketing is a diverse and varied field and the Cause Marketing Forum tries to provide actionable information that will be helpful to beginners and veterans,&#8221; said Hessekiel. (Please see sidebar for an overview of available resources.)</p>
<p>Those uninitiated in the philosophy and practice of cause-driven marketing campaigns should not feel intimidated. With resources provided by the Cause Marketing Forum, Inc., a basic grasp of the concept can expand to a graduate level understanding and cause marketing campaigns worthy of a doctoral dissertation.</p>
