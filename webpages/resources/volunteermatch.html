            VolunteerMatch: Igniting Fires & Fanning Flames of Volunteerism <br>
            Their 
            formal Mission Statement sums it up: VolunteerMatch is dedicated to 
            helping everyone find a great place to volunteer. Their official slogan 
            puts it even more succinctly: Get Out. Do Good. Need we, or they, say 
            more? Probably not, but brevity is not our strongest suit. Allow us 
            to sing the praises of VolunteerMatch.
        <br>
        <br>
        A familiar 
          tune from the roots of Americana repeats the refrain: It only takes 
          a spark to get a fire going, and soon all those around will warm up 
          to its glowing. VolunteerMatch provides the spark. Willing volunteers, 
          worthy nonprofit organizations, and corporate partners pour on the fuel 
          for a bonfire of satisfying opportunities; their cooperative efforts 
          result in a warm altruistic and philanthropic glow spreading through 
          communities across America.
    </p>
    <p>The successful 
        approach by VolunteerMatch is threefold. They provide Community Service 
        <img src="../../images/girl.gif"  vspace="5" align="l" style="float: left; margin-right: 7px;">Organizations 
        with a highly effective volunteer recruitment tool. Many small to medium 
        nonprofit groups benefit from VolunteerMatch's powerful presence within 
        the online community of giving. Individual volunteers receive instant 
        access to a wealth of opportunities linked to their geographic location, 
        age range, passion for particular causes, and hours of availability 
        for service. VolunteerMatch 's corporate services provides over 20 companies 
        with a far more efficient method of maximizing corporate volunteering 
        efforts.</p>
        <p>“VolunteerMatch 
            is designed to make it easier than ever for anyone to find a rewarding 
            way to volunteer,” said Jason Willett, director of communications 
            for VolunteerMatch. “We succeed because our community is made 
            up of a network of nonprofit, volunteer and business leaders committed 
            to civic engagement.”
        </p>
            <p>This triple 
                threat to apathy encourages participation by all sectors of the philanthropic 
                community: Volunteers, Community Service Groups, Corporate Partnerships. 
                The simplicity of the idea and the development of powerful software 
                have been the keys to VolunteerMatch's success. Their website is amazingly 
                easy to navigate. It includes an evolving list of elements used to narrow 
                a potential volunteers search for opportunities to work <img src="../../images/search.gif" style="float: right;">with 
                organizations. This criteria leads to potentially satisfying volunteer 
                experiences and promotes ongoing and growing levels of volunteer participation. 
                The result: individuals and organizations blazing with passion for service 
                to others. <br><br>
                Community 
                Service Organizations are encouraged to register with VolunteerMatch. 
                They are rewarded for registration with services to assist with the

                            again for making your site available to volunteers. Our little Village 
                            Temple Soup Kitchen in New York City, which feeds 150 needy people each 
                            week, has had over 1000 page views in the last 9 months and over 100 
                            new volunteers since I listed our opportunity on the VolunteerMatch 
                            site. It has really made a difference."<br>

                                been able to create extra volunteer opportunities! Thanks to VolunteerMatch, 
                                our program is expanding. And best of all, the service is so useful

                                    visitors are prompted to enter their ZIP code. Further information results 
                                    in a wide range of volunteer opportunities located within most communities.</p>

                                        scheduling and availability, and geographic location. Frustrations involved
