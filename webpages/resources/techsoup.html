               <p><img src="../../images/TS-color.jpg" style="float:right;">Tech Soup 
                   provides a literal Technical Knock-Out (TKO) for high-tech headaches 
                   plaguing nonprofit groups; courtesy of a one two punch from the information 
                   and products offered at TechSoup. TechSoup operates as a national web-based 
                   resource, providing invaluable computer and software information to 
                   nonprofit organizations on a daily basis. TechSoup also offers a product 
                   philanthropy service called DiscounTech that makes donated and discounted 
                   technology products available to nonprofit organizations with 501c3

                   <h4><strong>TechSoup</strong></h4>
                   <p>Debuting 
                       on May 9, 2000, TechSoup was an immediate heavyweight champ in the nonprofit 
                       sector, placing computer complications on the ropes for charitable groups 
                       of all sizes and weight classes. On any given day, TechSoup’s 
                       website serves up 380 how-to articles distributed between 16 technological 
                       categories. In addition, nonprofits can find 67 downloadable worksheets. 
                       All information is formulated by technology experts and nonprofit staff. 
                       (See our sidebar for a selection of current titles).</p>
                       
                           <p>Fifteen 
                             discussion forums are used by more than 3,000 members of the nonprofit 
                             community. Some messages refer to technological problems many readers 
                             encounter; others offer solutions to these specific issues and provide 
                             general applications information. Being surrounded by a formidable group 
                             of like-minded charitable workers provides moral support as well as 
                             technical assistance. The TechSoup message boards can also serve as 
                             a powerful networking venue for groups and individuals.</p>
                           <p>In this 
                             age of increasing reliance on information technology, TechSoup is a 
                             particularly popular disseminator of cutting-edge computer expertise. 
                             TechSoup’s E-newsletter, “By the Cup,” is read by 
                             34,000 subscribers each week. Website registration and E-newsletter 
                   
                             sign-up take mere minutes, yet reap ongoing rewards.<br>

                             for Charities and Nonprofits placed TechSoup #1 in its 2001 Top Ten

                               want to find out about IT information or resources for charities, 
                               then this is the place to go on the web. A technology site dedicated 
                               to the non-profit sector and with a fantastic amount of the most useful 
                               and important information. Updated since last year, it still contains 
                               the essential guides, articles and information on technology planning, 
                               hardware, software, using the internet, networks, databases and much 
                               more. And it now has a series of discussion (message) boards covering 
                               the same topics, where you can ask questions and get answers from 
                               IT experts and other charity users. And all built for the non-profit 
                               sector. Excellent.<br>

                                 Tech Soup provides 501c3 organizations with donated and discounted 
                                 technology products. Uppercuts to under-funding, left hooks to outdated 
                                 software and right jabs to archaic computer equipment have been accomplished 
                                 through impressive corporate partnerships. </p>
                               <p>Twenty-five 
                                 individual providers of computer equipment and valuable software have 
                                 teamed up with DiscounTech to offer over 240 donated and discounted 
                                 products and services. They are available to qualifying organizations 
                                 for a nominal administrative fee (that includes shipping, handling, 
                                 and live customer support). Because product providers place their own 
                                 restrictions on eligibility, terms of use vary accordingly.</p>

                                 is provided by free subscription and read by 22,000 subscribers. Since 
                                 the service launched in 2002, almost 20,000 organizations have received 
                                 more than 576,000 products through this service. This translates to 
                                 more than $160 million in nonprofit funds freed-up for alternative uses 
                                 within the charitable sector.</p>

                                 nonprofit groups have crowned a champion in their ongoing battle against 
                                 outdated technological tools. What they’re saying:</p>
                                 <blockquote> 
                                    <p>You 
                                      are providing a terrific service to the nonprofit industry especially 
                                      the small nonprofits who struggle and have a difficult time making 
                                      ends meet with their programming much less with technology upgrades. 
                                      Thanks to you, my organization now has Office 2000 and we have greatly 
                                      improved our capacity. Buckets of thanks for a great service to the 
                                      nonprofit community!!! </p>

                                      Condy</em><em>, Stage to Stage, Inc, New Orleans</em></p>
                                    <p>I recently 
                                      received the shipment of products I ordered and I can not begin to 
                                      thank you enough. We received well over $10,000 worth of product for 
                                      a little under $1,000. And the shipment arrived in less than 2 weeks 
                                      from order date!</p>
                                    <p>We are 
                                      a small, but growing (thanks to you) non-profit specializing in mental 
                                      health services. We just celebrated our 50th Year serving the Merrimack 
                                      Valley here in Massachusetts. Over the years many agencies have had 
                                      to close their doors, but we have managed not only to survive but 
                                      to grow at a slow and steady pace.</p>
                                    <p>With 
                                      over 90% of our budget directly funding services, little is left for 
                                      technology. Thanks to the DiscounTech program we now have a network 
                                      of 15 computers at our main office with a VPN connecting a satellite 
                                      office with 5 computers. Our goal is to eventually equip every clinician, 
                                      every offsite program, and every staffer out in the community with 
                                      PC's and the ability to communicate with central office anytime and 
                                      anyplace.</p>
                                    <p>Thank 
                                      you again DiscounTech! Thank you from all the staff and the people 
                                      we serve.</p>
